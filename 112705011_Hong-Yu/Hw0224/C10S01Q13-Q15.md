## Solution
The data points exhibit a strong alignment along the straight line, indicating a consistent pattern without significant deviations. 
This close adherence suggests that the underlying distribution of the data closely resembles a normal distribution. 
The absence of noticeable outliers or systematic departures from the linear trend further supports the assumption that the data are approximately normally distributed.

## Question 14

## Solution
The data points exhibit significant deviations from the straight line, particularly at the lower and upper ends of the distribution. This pronounced departure from linearity indicates that the underlying data do not follow a normal distribution. In a normal probability plot, data points should align closely with the reference line, but in this case, the observed curvature or dispersion suggests the presence of skewness, heavy tails, or other forms of non-normality. Such deviations may indicate that the data come from a skewed, bimodal, or heavy-tailed distribution, rather than a normal population. Consequently, statistical methods that assume normality may not be appropriate for analyzing this dataset.

## Solution
The boxplot appears roughly symmetric, with the median near the center and whiskers of similar length on both sides. The absence of significant skewness or extreme outliers suggests that the data distribution is balanced. While a boxplot alone cannot confirm normality, its symmetry indicates that the data are likely to be approximately normally distributed.
