## Solution for (a)
Since the p-value of 0.113 exceeds the significance level \( \alpha = 0.05 \), we do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. As a result, there is not enough statistical support to conclude that the mean weight of the packages is different from 1 pound. Furthermore, the confidence interval \( (0.9867, 1.1178) \) includes the hypothesized mean of 1, reinforcing the decision to fail to reject \( H_0 \).

## Solution for (b)


The value of $t = \frac{\bar{x}-\mu_0}{SE} = \frac{1.0522-1}{0.0319} \approx 1.64$

Thus, $t$ matched the MINITAB output.

------------------------------------------------------------

$t_{26, 0.025} = 2.056$  

construct a 95% C.I.  

$\bar{x} \pm t_{26; 0.025} \times \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} = 1.0522 \pm 2.056 \times \frac{0.1657}{\sqrt{27}} \approx (0.9867, 1.1178)$
