## Solution for a.

$H_0$ : $\mu = 25$  

$H_a$ : $\mu \lt 25$  

set $\alpha = 0.05$  

$t = \frac{\bar{x}-\mu}{s/\sqrt{n}} = \frac{20.3-25}{5/\sqrt{21}} \approx -4.31$  

for $-t_{20, 0.05} = -1.725 \gt -4.31$, reject $H_0$  

There is sufficient evidence to conclude that the true pretreatment mean is less than 25 at $\alpha = 0.05$

## Solution for b.  

$t_{20, 0.025} = 2.086$  

construct a 95% C.I.  

$\bar{x} \pm t_{20, 0.025} \times \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} = 26.6 \pm 2.086 \times \frac{7.4}{\sqrt{21}} \approx (23.232, 29.968)$  

## Solution for c.
There is a clear and noticeable increase in the mean values observed from the pretreatment phase to the posttreatment phase, followed by a further increase from the posttreatment phase to the follow-up phase. These consistent upward trends in the mean values strongly suggest that the treatment had a meaningful and statistically significant effect on the measured outcome. Furthermore, the sustained increase over time indicates that the beneficial effects of the treatment did not diminish after the initial intervention but rather persisted, and there is even some evidence to suggest that the improvement continued to progress slightly as time went on.
