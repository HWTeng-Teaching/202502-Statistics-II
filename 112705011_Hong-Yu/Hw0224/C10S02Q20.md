## Solution
$H_0: \mu = 74$

$H_a: \mu \neq 74$
  
$\alpha=0.05$
  
Since $n = 25 < 30$, we use t-test.

$t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{s / \sqrt{n}} = \frac{69.7 - 74}{16 / \sqrt{25}} = -1.34375$
     
The critical points are $\pm t_{24, 0.05 / 2} = \pm t_{24, 0.025} = \pm 2.064$  
Therefore, the rejection region is $t < -2.064$ or $t > 2.064$.
     
Since $-2.064 < t < 2.064$, $H_0$ is not rejected, which means there is no sufficient evidence to show that the average CBF for stroke patients is different from that of healthy people.
