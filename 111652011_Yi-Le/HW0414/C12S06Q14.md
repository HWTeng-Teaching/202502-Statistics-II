Yes, because each flavor of calories and total fat seems has positive relationship that higher calories has higher total fat.

## Solution of b
$S_{xx} = 10971.429$  
$S_{yy} = 108.857$  
$S_{xy} = 1004.286$  
$r = \frac{S_{xy}}{\sqrt{S_{xx} S_{yy}}} = 0.919$  
Thus, there is a strong positive linear relationship between calories and total fat.
