## Solution of a
The random error Îµ must have a normal distribution with mean 0 and a common variance $\sigma^2$ , independent of x.

## Solution of b
The best estimate of $\sigma^2$ is $\sigma^2 \approx \text{MSE} = 58.05$

## Solution of c
In the normal probability plot, the residuals are showing normality. Valid is the normal distribution assumption.  
In the residuals versus fits plot, there are residueals that do not scatter randomly around y = 0. It violates the assumption of equal variances.
