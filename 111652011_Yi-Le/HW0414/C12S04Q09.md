## Solution of a

An $r^2$ value of 0.027 means that only 2.7% of the variation in price can be explained by the variation in screen size.  
Thus, the relationship between screen size and price is very weak.

## Solution of b

Normal Probability Plot (Q-Q Plot):
The points roughly follow a straight line.  
Thus, the normality assumption seems reasonable (not clearly violated).  

Residuals vs. Fitted Plot:
There is no clear pattern and residuals are spread relatively evenly around zero.  
Thus, The equal variance assumption also seems not violated.

## Solution of c
