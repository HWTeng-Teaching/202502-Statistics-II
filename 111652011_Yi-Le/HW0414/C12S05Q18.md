Yes, the scatterplot and regression output suggest a linear trend between the amount of phosphorus applied and the phosphorus level in the plant.

## Solution of b

$\hat{y} = a + bx$  
$S_{xy} = 88.4667$  
$S_{xx} = 0.3267$  
$\bar{x} = 0.2834$  
$\bar{y} = 157.5834$  
$b = \frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}} = 270.82$  
$a = \bar{y} - b \bar{x} = 80.85$  
Thus, the least-squares line is: $\hat{y} = 80.85 + 270.82x$  

## Solution of c
$H_0: b = 0$  
$H_a: b \neq 0$
$\alpha = 0.05$
Since P-value $= 0.003 < 0.05$, $H_0$ is rejected i.e. the data provide sufficient evidence to indicate that the amount of phosphorus present in the plant is to the soil.

## Solution of d
$\hat{y} = 135.015$  
$t_{n-2,0.1} = t_{10,0.1} = 1.812$  
$s=\sqrt{\frac{\sum (y_i - \hat{y_i})^2}{n-2}} = 39.04190$  
$SE_{\hat{y}} = s \cdot \sqrt{ \frac{1}{n} + \frac{(x_0 - \bar{x})^2}{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2} } = 12.6264$  
90% CI = $(112.136, 157.894)$
