## Solution of a.

$H_0$ : $\mu = 25$  
$H_a$ : $\mu \lt 25$  
set $\alpha = 0.05$  

$t = \frac{\bar{x}-\mu}{s/\sqrt{n}} = \frac{20.3-25}{5/\sqrt{21}} \approx -4.31$  

Since $-t_{20; 0.05} = -1.725 \gt -4.31$, reject $H_0$  

There is sufficient evidence to conclude that the true pretreatment mean is less than 25 at $\alpha = 0.05$

## Solution of b.  

$t_{20, 0.025} = 2.086$  

construct a 95% C.I.  

$\bar{x} \pm t_{20; 0.025} \times \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} = 26.6 \pm 2.086 \times \frac{7.4}{\sqrt{21}} \approx (23.232, 29.968)$  

## Solution of c.
There is a clear increase in the mean values from pretreatment to posttreatment and posttreatment to follow-up. The increases suggest that the treatment had a significant effect, and the effect appears to persist or even slightly increase over time.
