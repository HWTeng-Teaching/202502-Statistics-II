## Solution of (a)
$H_0$ : $\mu = 22$  
$H_a$ : $\mu \gt 22$  

$t = \frac{31-22}{6.2/\sqrt{17}} \approx 5.985$  

$Since t_{16,0.05} = 1.746 \lt 5.985$  
Therefore reject $H_0$  

There is sufficent evidence that injected rats drink more water than noninjected rats

## Solution of (b)
construct a 90% C.I.

$t_{16, 0.05} = 1.746$  
$\bar{x} \pm t_{16; 0.05} \times \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} = 31 \pm 1.746 \times \frac{6.2}{\sqrt{17}} \approx (28.375, 33.625)$
