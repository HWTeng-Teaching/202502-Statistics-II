## Solution of (a)
$H_0$ : $\mu = 1$  
$H_a$ : $\mu \lt 1$  
set $\alpha = 0.05$  
Since the p-value 0.113 is greater than $\alpha = 0.05$, there is not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis.  
Therefore, there is not sufficient evidence to conclude that the mean weight of the packages differs from 1 pound.  
The confidence interval (0.9867, 1.1178) contains the hypothesized mean of 1, which is consistent with failing to reject $H_0$.

## Solution of (b)
