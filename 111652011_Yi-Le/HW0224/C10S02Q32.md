## Solution of (a)
Since the p-value 0.113 is greater than $\alpha = 0.05$, there is not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis.  
Therefore, there is not sufficient evidence to conclude that the mean weight of the packages differs from 1 pound.  
The confidence interval (0.9867, 1.1178) contains the hypothesized mean of 1, which is consistent with failing to reject $H_0$.

## Solution of (b)
Varify the calculated values of t:

$t=\frac{\bar{x}-\mu_0}{SE}

The upper and lower confidence limits:

$t_{26, 0.025} = 2.056$  

construct a 95% C.I.  

$\bar{x} \pm t_{26; 0.025} \times \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} = 1.0522 \pm 2.056 \times \frac{0.1657}{\sqrt{27}} \approx (0.9867, 1.1178)$
