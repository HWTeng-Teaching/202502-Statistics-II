## Solution
$\mu=74$ &emsp; $n=25$ &emsp; $\bar{x}=69.7$ &emsp; $s=16$

$X\sim N(\mu,\sigma^2)$

$X_1,X_2,…X_{25}\sim N(\mu,\sigma^2)$

$\bar{X}=\frac{X_1,X_2,…X_{25}}{25}\sim N(\mu,\frac{\sigma^2}{25})$

$H_0: \mu = 74 \quad \quad H_a: \mu \neq 74$
  
$\alpha$ is given by the question. $\quad \alpha=0.05$
  
The test statistic and its sampling distribution is  

$$
t_{\text{STAT}} = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{s / \sqrt{n}} \sim t_{(n - 1)} \quad \Rightarrow \quad t_{\text{STAT}}
= \frac{\bar{x} - 74}{s / \sqrt{n}} \sim t_{(25 - 1)} \quad \Rightarrow \quad t_{\text{STAT}} = \frac{\bar{x} - 74}{s / \sqrt{n}} \sim t_{24}
$$
     
The realized statistic  

$$
t^* = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{s / \sqrt{n}} = \frac{69.7 - 74}{16 / \sqrt{25}} = -1.34375
$$
     
The critical points are $\pm t_{\alpha / 2} \Rightarrow \pm t_{0.05 / 2} = \pm t_{0.025} = \pm 2.064$  
   Therefore, the rejection region is $t < -2.064$ or $t > 2.064$.
     
Because $t = -1.34375$ does not fall into the rejection region, $H_0$ is not rejected, which means there is no sufficient evidence to show that the average CBF for stroke patients is different from that of healthy people.
