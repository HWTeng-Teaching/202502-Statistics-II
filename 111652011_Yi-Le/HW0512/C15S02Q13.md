## Solution of a
| Pair |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |  8  |  9  |  10 |
|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| sign |  -  |  -  |  +  |  -  |  -  |  +  |  -  |  -  |  -  |  -  |

$n = 10$  
$H_0: p = 0.5$  
$H_a: p \neq 0.5$  
$\alpha = 0.1$  
test statistic: number of +  
realized statistic: $x = 2$  
$p-value = 2*P(x \leq 2) = 2 \times 0.055 = 0.11$  
Since $0.11 > 0.1$, $H_0$ is not rejected i.e. there is no sufficient evidence to indicate a higher recovery rate for one of the two drugs.

## Solution of b
It is inappropriate to use the Student's t-test in analyzing the data if the data is not normal distribution.
