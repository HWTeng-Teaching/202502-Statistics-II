|------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Chef A     | 6   | 4   | 7   | 8   | 2   | 7   | 9   | 7   | 2   | 4   | 6   |
| Chef B     | 8   | 5   | 4   | 7   | 3   | 4   | 9   | 8   | 5   | 3   | 9   |

| Chef A     | 8   | 4   | 3   | 6   | 9   | 9   | 4   | 4   | 5   | 3   | 5   |
| Chef B     | 5   | 2   | 3   | 8   | 10  | 8   | 6   | 3   | 4   | 2   | 3   |

$H_0: p=0.5$  
$H_a: p \neq 0.5$  
$\alpha = 0.05$  
$n = 20$  
test statistic: number of +  
realized statistic: $x = 11$  
P-value = 2 \times P(X >= 11) = 2 \times (1-0.588) = 0.824$  
Since $0.824 > 0.05$, $H_0$ is not rejected i.e. there is no sufficient evidence to indicate that one of the chefs tends to give higer ratings than the other

## Solution of b
$H_0: p=0.5$  
$H_a: p \neq 0.5$  
$\alpha = 0.05$  
$z_{STAT} = \frac{x-0.5n}{0.5\sqrt{n}}$  
$z^* = \frac{11 - 0.5 \times 20}{0.5 \times \sqrt{20}} = 0.4472$  
The rejection region is $\\{z: z < -1.96 or z > 1.96\\}$  
Since $-1.96 < 0.4472 < 1.96$, $H_0$ is not rejected i.e. there is no sufficient evidence to indicate that one of the chefs tends to give higer ratings than the other

## Solution of c
The results of part a. and part b. are same.
