## Solution of a
| Pair |  1  |  2  |  3  |   4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |
|------|-----|-----|-----|------|-----|-----|-----|
| diff | 0.1 | 0.7 | 0.3 | -0.1 | 0.5 | 0.2 | 0.5 |
| rank | 1.5 |  7  |  4  | 1.5  | 5.5 |  3  | 5.5 |

$T_+ = 1.5 + 7 + 4 + 5.5 + 3 + 5.5 = 26.5$  
$T_- = 1.5$  
$n = 7$  
$H_0 : p = 0.5$  
$H_a : p \neq 0.5$  
$\alpha = 0.1$  
test statistic: $T = min(T_+, T_-)$  
realized statistic: $T = min(T_+, T_-) = min(26.5,1.5) = 1.5$  
The rejection region is $\\{T | T \leq 4 \\}$  
Since $1.5 < 4$, $H_0$ is not rejected i.e. there is significant difference between the two populations.

## Solution of b
The result of the exercise 4 is not to reject $H_0$.
They are not the same, since the sign test only considers the sign of the differences, but the Wilcoxon signed-rank test considers the rank of differences.
