## Solution
1: Deaf Children  
2: Hearing Children  
$H_0$: The distributions of eye-movement rates for deaf children and hearing children are same  
$H_a$: The distributions of eye-movement rates for deaf children and hearing children are different  
$\alpha = 0.05$  
$n_1=9 \quad n_2=9$  
$T_1 = 126 \quad T_2 = 45$  
$n_1 + (n_1 + n_2 + 1) - T_1 = 126$  
$T^* = min(126, 45) = 45$  
By the table, the critical value of T is for a two-tailed test with Î±/2 is $T = 62$  
Since $45 < 62$, $H_0$ is rejected i.e. there is sufficient evidence to indicate the distributions of eye-movement rates for deaf children and hearing children differ.
