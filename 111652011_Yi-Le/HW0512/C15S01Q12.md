## Solution of a

| Above Town | 2.5 | 10  | 7.5 |  5  |  9  |
|------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Below Town | 7.5 |  1  |  5  | 2.5 |  5  |

$H_0$ : The two population distributions are the same  
$H_a$ : Population 1 is to the right of population 2  
$\alpha = 0.05$  
$n_1 = 5 \quad n_2 = 5$  
T_1 = 2.5 + 5 + 7.5 + 9 + 10 = 34  
T_1^* = n_1 (n_1 + n_2 + 1) - T_1 = 5 * 11 - 34 = 21$  
Critical value $T = 19$  
Thus, the rejected region is { $T: T \leq 19$ }  
Since $21 > 19$, $H_0$ is not rejected i.e. there is not sufficient evidence to confirm the theory.
