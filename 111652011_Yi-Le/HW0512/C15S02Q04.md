## Solution
$H_0$: There is not significant differences between the two populations  
$H_a$: There is significant differences between the two populations  
| Pair | Pop 1 | Pop 2 | Difference |
|------|-------|-------|------------|
| 1    | 8.9   | 8.8   | +0.1       |
| 2    | 8.1   | 7.4   | +0.7       |
| 3    | 9.3   | 9.0   | +0.3       |
| 4    | 7.7   | 7.8   | -0.1       |
| 5    |10.4   | 9.9   | +0.5       |
| 6    | 8.3   | 8.1   | +0.2       |
| 7    | 7.4   | 6.9   | +0.5       |

Number of + : 6  
Number of - : 1  
$P(X \ge 6) = 1 - P(X < 6) = 0.062$  
Since $0.062 * 2 = 0.124 > \alpha$, $H_0$ is not rejected i.e. there is not significant differences between the two populations.
