## Solution of a
1. $H_0: \sigma_1^2 - \sigma_2^2 = 0 \quad \sigma_1^2 - \sigma_2^2 \neq 0$
2. $\alpha = 0.01$
3. $F = \frac{S_2^2 / \sigma_2^2}{S_1^2 / \sigma_1^2} \sim F_{14,14}$
4. $F^* = \frac{2.96}{1.54} = 1.922$
5. Since $F^* < 3.66 = F_{15,14,0.01}$, $F^* < F_{14,14,0.01}$.
Thus, P-value > 0.01.
6. Since P-value > $\alpha$, $H_0$ is not rejected i.e. there is not a sufficient evidence to indicate a difference between the variabilities.
