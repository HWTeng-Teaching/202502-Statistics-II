## Question
#### When using rule of thumb to check if two variances are the same, approximate the significance level with $n_1 = 4$ and $n_2 = 3$.

## Solution
The rule of thumb states that if:

$$
\frac{S_1^2}{S_2^2} < 3
$$

then the two variances are considered approximately equal.

To find the significance level, we need to determine $P(F^* < 3)$ for $F_{(3,2)}$

Since $3 < 9.16$, we know that the significance level is more than 0.1.

By using ChatGPT, I get the significance level is about 0.26.
