## Solution of a

$\hat{y} = a + bx$  
$b = -1.251 \quad a = 93.617$  
Thus, $\hat{y} = 93.617 - 1.251x$  
## Solution of b

1. $H_0: \beta = 0 \quad H_a: \beta \neq 0$  
  
2. Set $\alpha = 0.05$  
  
3. The test statistic and its sampling distribution

$$
t_{\text{STAT}} = \frac{b-0}{\sqrt{MSE/S_{xx}}} \sim t_{(n-2)=5}
$$

4. The realized statistic

$$
t^* = -10.471
$$

5. The rejection region is $\\{t : t > t_{5;0.025} = 2.571 \text{ or } t < -t_{5;0.025} = -2.571 \\}$
  
6. Since $t = -10.471 < -2.571$, $H_0$ is rejected i.e. the data provides sufficient evidence to indicate that x and y are linearly related.

## Solution of c

Construct 95% CI:  
Lower: -1.559  
Upper: $\ -1.251 + 2.571 * 0.12 = -0.942\$  
Thus, the 95% CI is (-1.559, -0.942)
## Solution of d

$R^2 = 0.9564$  
That is, about 95.64% of the variation in the percentage arrested can be explained by the linear relationship with group median age.
