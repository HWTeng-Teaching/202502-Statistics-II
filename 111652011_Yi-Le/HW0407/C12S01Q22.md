The points are clustered near the gray dashed line $y=x$, which represents perfect agreement between armspan and height. This suggests a strong, approximately linear relationship with positive correlation.

## Solution of b

If armspan = height, the slope of the regression line would be positive and close to 1, showing that they are positive correlation.

## Solution of c

$\hat{y} = a + bx$  
$\sum x_iy_i = 221414 \quad \quad \bar{x} = 166 \quad \quad \bar{y}=166.375 \quad \quad n=8$  
$\sum x_i^2 = 221016 \quad \quad \bar{x}^2 = 27556$  

$$
b = \frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}} = \frac{\sum x_iy_i - n \bar{x} \bar{y}}{\sum x_i^2 - n \bar{x}^2} = \frac{221414-8*166\*166.375}{221016-8\*27556} \approx 0.8239
$$

$$
a = \bar{y} - b \bar{x} = 166.375 - 0.8239*166 = 29.6076
$$

Thus, the least-squares regression line is

$$
\hat{y} = a + bx \Rightarrow \hat{y} = 29.6076 + 0.8239x
$$

$b=0.8239$ is positive and close to 1, confirming my conclusion in part (b).

## Solution of d

$$
\hat{y} = 29.6076 + 0.8239x
$$

$$
\hat{y} = 29.6076 + 0.8239*157 \approx 158.96
$$

Thus, I would predict the person's height to be 158.96.
