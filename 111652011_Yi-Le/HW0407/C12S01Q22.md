The points are clustered near the gray dashed line $y=x$, which represents perfect agreement between armspan and height. This suggests a strong, approximately linear relationship with positive correlation.

## Solution of b

If armspan = height, the slope of the regression line should be 1, and the intercept should ideally be 0, meaning Height = Armspan.

## Solution of c
