## Solution of b
Let Year be y, miles of US urban raodway be x.
$\hat{y} = a + bx$  
$n = 16$  
$\bar{x} = 7.5$  
$\bar{x}^2 = 56.25$  
$\sum x_i^2 = 1240$  
$\bar{y}=1.04125$  
$\sum x_iy_i = 132.8$

$$
b = \frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}} = \frac{\sum x_iy_i - n \bar{x} \bar{y}}{\sum x_i^2 - n \bar{x}^2} = \frac{132.8-16*7.5\*1.04125}{1240-16\*56.25} \approx 0.0231
$$

$$
a = \bar{y} - b \bar{x} = 1.04125 - 0.0231*7.5 = 0.868
$$

Thus, the least-squares regression line is

$$
\hat{y} = a + bx \Rightarrow \hat{y} = 0.868 + 0.0231x
$$

1. $H_0: \beta = 0 \quad H_a: \beta \neq 0$  

2. Set $\alpha = 0.05$  

3. The test statistic and its sampling distribution

$$
t_{\text{STAT}} = \frac{b-0}{\sqrt{MSE/S_{xx}}} \sim t_{(n-2)=14}
$$

4. The realized statistic

$$
t^* = \frac{b-0}{\sqrt{MSE/S_{xx}}} = \frac{0.0231}{0.0004/(1240-16*56.25)} \approx 21.2971  
$$

5. The rejection region is $\\{t : t > t_{14;0.025} = 2.145 \text{ or } t < -t_{14;0.025} = -2.145 \\}$  

6. Since $t = 21.2971 > 2.145$, $H_0$ is rejected i.e. the data indicate that there is a linear relationship between the number of miles of roadways and the year.
## Solution of c

$n = 16$  

$\sum y_i^2 = 17.5336 \quad \quad \bar{y}^2 \approx 1.0842$  

$Total \quad SS = \sum y_i^2 - n \bar{y}^2 = 17.5336 - 16*1.0842 = 0.1864$  

$SSR = \frac{S_{xy}^2}{S_{xx}} = \frac{(\sum x_iy_i - n \bar{x} \bar{y})^2}{\sum x_i^2 - n \bar{x}^2} = \frac{(132.8-16*7.5\*1.04125)^2}{1240-16\*56.25} \approx 0.1812$  

$SSE = Total \quad SS - SSR = 0.1864 - 0.1812 = 0.0052$  
  
$MSR = \frac{SSR}{1} = 0.1812$  
  
$MSE = \frac{SSE}{n-2} = \frac{0.0052}{14} \approx 0.0004$  
  
$F = \frac{MSR}{MSE} = \frac{0.1812}{0.0004} = 453$  
  
| Source     |  df | SS     | MS     | F      |
|------------|-----|--------|--------|--------|
| regression |  1  | 0.1812 | 0.1812 | 453    |
| Error      | 14  | 0.0052 | 0.0004 |        |
| Total      | 15  | 0.1864 |        |        |

1. $H_0:$ model is not useful in explaining the response varuable
$H_a:$ model is useful in explaining the response varuable  
  
2. Set $\alpha = 0.05$  
  
3. The test statistic and its sampling distribution  

$$
F_{\text{STAT}} = \frac{MSR}{MSE} \sim F_{(1,n-2)=1,14}
$$

4. The realized statistic

$$
F^* = \frac{MSR}{MSE} = 453 
$$

5. The rejection region is $\\{F: F > F_{1,14;0.05} = 4.60 \\}$ 
  
6. Since $F = 453 > 4.60$, $H_0$ is rejected i.e. the data indicate that there is a linear relationship between the number of miles of roadways and the year.  

$t^2 = 21.2971^2 \approx 453.5665$ is close to $F=453$.  
Due to rounding, there may be errors in calculating, and make $t^2$ different to $F$.  
If there is no error, the $t^2$ will equal to $F$.  

## Solution of d

$r^2 = (\frac{S_{xy}}{\sqrt{S_{xx}S_{yy}}})^2 = \frac{S_{xy}^2}{S_{xx}S_{yy}} = \frac{(132.8-16*7.5\*1.04125)^2}{(1240-16\*56.25)\*(17.5336 - 16\*1.0842)} \approx 0.9723$  

which means that 97.25% of the variation in the miles of roadways can be explained by the linear relationship with the year.
