## Solution of a

The least-squares regression line is: $\hat{y} = a + bx$  
where

$$
b = \frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}} = \frac{\sum x_iy_i - n \bar{x} \bar{y}}{\sum x_i^2 - n \bar{x}^2} = \frac{14922.41-10*26.49\*27.2}{14935.37-10\*701.7201} \approx 0.9746
$$

$$
a = \bar{y} - b \bar{x} = 27.2 - 0.9746*26.49 = 1.3828
$$

Thus, the least-squares regression line is $\hat{y} = a + bx \Rightarrow \hat{y} = 1.3828 + 0.9746x$

## Solution of b

Since the points are close to the least-squares regression line, the assumption of a linear relationship appears to be reasonable.
