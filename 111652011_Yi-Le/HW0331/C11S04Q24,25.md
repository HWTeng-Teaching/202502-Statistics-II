## Solution of 24.a

blocks: items  
treatments: stores  

## Solution of 24.b

1. $H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2 = \mu_3 = \mu_4 \quad \quad H_a:$ At least one mean is different   
  
2. Set $\alpha = 0.05$  
  
3. Test statistic and its sampling distribution

$$
F_{\text{STAT}} = \frac{MST}{MSE} \sim F_{(k-1), (k-1)(b-1) = 3, 21}
$$

4. The realized statistic $F^* = 26.52$

5. The rejection region $= \\{ F : F>F_{3, 21, 0.05} \\} = \\{ F : F > 3.07 \\}$  
  
6. Since $F = 26.52 > 3.07$, $H_0$ is rejected i.e. there is significant difference in prices from store to store.

## Solution of 24.c

1. $H_0: \mu_A = \mu_B = ... = \mu_H \quad \quad H_a:$ At least one mean is different   
  
2. Set $\alpha = 0.05$  
  
3. Test statistic and its sampling distribution

$$
F_{\text{STAT}} = \frac{MST}{MSE} \sim F_{(b-1), (k-1)(b-1) = 7, 21}
$$

4. The realized statistic $F^* = 35.32$

5. The rejection region $= \\{ F : F>F_{7, 21, 0.05} \\} = \\{ F : F > 2.4876 \\}$  
  
6. Since $F = 35.32 > 2.4876$, $H_0$ is rejected i.e. there is significant difference from block to block.  
Blocking is effective.
