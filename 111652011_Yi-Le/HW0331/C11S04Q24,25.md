## Solution of 24.a

blocks: items  
treatments: stores  

## Solution of 24.b

1. $H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2 = \mu_3 = \mu_4 \quad \quad H_a:$ At least one mean is different   
  
2. Set $\alpha = 0.05$  
  
3. Test statistic and its sampling distribution

$$
F_{\text{STAT}} = \frac{MST}{MSE} \sim F_{(k-1), (k-1)(b-1) = 3, 21}
$$

4. The realized statistic $F^* = 26.52$

5. The rejection region $= \\{ F : F>F_{3, 21, 0.05} \\} = \\{ F : F > 3.07 \\}$  
  
6. Since $F = 26.52 > 3.07$, $H_0$ is rejected i.e. there is significant difference in prices from store to store.

## Solution of 24.c

1. $H_0: \mu_A = \mu_B = ... = \mu_H \quad \quad H_a:$ At least one mean is different   
  
2. Set $\alpha = 0.05$  
  
3. Test statistic and its sampling distribution

$$
F_{\text{STAT}} = \frac{MST}{MSE} \sim F_{(b-1), (k-1)(b-1) = 7, 21}
$$

4. The realized statistic $F^* = 35.32$

5. The rejection region $= \\{ F : F>F_{7, 21, 0.05} \\} = \\{ F : F > 2.4876 \\}$  
  
6. Since $F = 35.32 > 2.4876$, $H_0$ is rejected i.e. there is significant difference from block to block.  
Blocking is effective.
   
## Solution of 25.a

$q_{0.05}(k,df) = q_{0.05}(4,21) = 3.942$

## Solution of 25.b

$\omega = q_{0.05}(k,df) * \sqrt{\frac{MSE}{b}} = 3.942 * \sqrt{\frac{0.1658}{8}} \approx 0.5675$

## Solution of 25.c

$|\bar{T}_1 - \bar{T}_2| = 0.4875 < \omega$  i.e.  $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ are not differ significantly.  
$|\bar{T}_1 - \bar{T}_3| = 0.205 < \omega$  i.e.  $\mu_1$ and $\mu_3$ are not differ significantly.  
$|\bar{T}_1 - \bar{T}_4| = 1.65875 > \omega$  i.e.  $\mu_1$ and $\mu_4$ are differ significantly.  
$|\bar{T}_2 - \bar{T}_3| = 0.2825 < \omega$  i.e.  $\mu_2$ and $\mu_3$ are not differ significantly.  
$|\bar{T}_2 - \bar{T}_4| = 1.17125 > \omega$  i.e.  $\mu_2$ and $\mu_4$ are differ significantly.  
$|\bar{T}_3 - \bar{T}_4| = 1.45375 > \omega$  i.e.  $\mu_3$ and $\mu_4$ are differ significantly.  

WinCo store differs significantly in average prices of the selected items
