## Solution of a
1. $H_0:\mu_A = \mu_B = \mu_C \quad H_a$:at least one mean is differ
2. Set $\alpha = 0.05$.

Since $P-value = 0.0251 < 0.05$, $H_0$ is rejected.  
Thus, there is a significant difference in mean assembly times for people trained by the three programs.

## Solution of b
99% CI for the difference in means of A and B:

$$
(\bar{x}_A - \bar{x}_B) \pm t\_{0.01/2;2} * \sqrt{MSE*(\frac{1}{n_A} + \frac{1}{n_B})}  
= (60.5- 54.667) \pm 3.250 * \sqrt{14.941*(\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{3})}  
= (−3.7617, 15.4277)
$$

## Solution of c
99% CI for the mean of A:

$$
\bar{x}_A \pm t\_{0.01/2;4-1} * \frac{s_A}{\sqrt{n_A}}  
= 60.5 \pm 5.841 * \sqrt{\frac{9.667}{4}}  
= (51.4196, 69.5804)
$$

## Solution of d
Since there is no evidence of extreme skewness or outliers and the ANOVA F-test is fairly robust to moderate violations of normality,  
it’s reasonable to assume approximate normality, especially if the data were randomly sampled.
