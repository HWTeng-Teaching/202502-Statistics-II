## Solution of a
1. $H_0:\mu_A = \mu_B = \mu_C \quad H_a$:at least one mean is differ
2. Set $\alpha = 0.05$.

Since $P-value = 0.0251 < 0.05$, $H_0$ is rejected.  
Thus, there is a significant difference in mean assembly times for people trained by the three programs.

## Solution of b
99% CI for the difference in means of A and B:

$$
99\\% CI = (\bar{x}_A - \bar{x}_B) \pm t\_{0.01/2;2} * \sqrt{MSE*(\frac{1}{n_A} + \frac{1}{n_B})}
$$

$$
99\\% CI = (60.5- 54.667) \pm 9.925 * \sqrt{14.941*(\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{3})}
$$

$$
99\\% CI = (-17.49 , 29.15)
$$
