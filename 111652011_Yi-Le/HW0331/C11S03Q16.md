## Solution

$s = \sqrt{MSE} = \sqrt{41.25} = 6.422$

$SE = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n_i}} = \frac{6.422}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{6.422}{2.236} = 2.872$

$q_{0.01}(4, 16) \approx 5.19$

$\omega = q \cdot SE = 5.19 \times 2.872 = 14.906$

$| \bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2 | = 27.4 > \omega \Rightarrow \mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ are differ significantly.  
$| \bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_3 | = 10.6 < \omega \Rightarrow \mu_1$ and $\mu_3$ are not differ significantly.  
$| \bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_4 | = 6.4 < \omega \Rightarrow \mu_1$ and $\mu_4$ are not differ significantly.  
$| \bar{x}_2 - \bar{x}_3 | = 16.8 > \omega \Rightarrow \mu_2$ and $\mu_3$ are differ significantly.  
$| \bar{x}_2 - \bar{x}_4 | = 33.8 > \omega \Rightarrow \mu_2$ and $\mu_4$ are differ significantly.  
$| \bar{x}_3 - \bar{x}_4 | = 17 > \omega \Rightarrow \mu_3$ and $\mu_4$ are differ significantly.
