## Solution of a

x: Years of Competitive Running  
y: 10-Kilometer Finish Time

| Runner | Rank x | Rank y | difference(d) |
|--------|--------|--------|---------------|
|    1   |    7   |    1   |       6       |
|    2   |    9   |    2   |       7       |
|    3   |  3.5   |    3   |     0.5       |
|    4   |    6   |    4   |       2       |
|    5   |    8   |    5   |       3       |
|    6   |    5   |    6   |      -1       |
|    7   |    2   |    7   |      -5       |
|    8   |  3.5   |    8   |    -4.5       |
|    9   |    1   |    9   |      -8       |

$r_s=1 - frac{6}{n(n^2-1)}\sum{d_i^2} = -0.7375$  

## Solution of b

$H_0: \rho_s = 0$  
$H_a: \rho_s < 0$  
$\alpha = 0.05$  
$r_{9, 0.05} = -0.6$  
Thus, the rejection region is $\\{r: r < -0.6\\}$  
Since $-0.7375 < -0.6$, $H_0$ is rejected i.e. the data provide evidence to indicate a significant rank correlation between the two variables.
