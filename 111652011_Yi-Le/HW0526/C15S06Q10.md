## Solution of a

The randomized block design.

## Solution of b

For the scatter plot of residuals and antibiotic, it's clear that the variance of antibiotic 1 and antibiotic 2 are different.  
Thus, the common variance assumption is not satisfied.

## Solution of c

|antibiotic| T1| T2| T3| T4|
|----------|---|---|---|---|
|  Child 1 | 2 | 1 | 4 | 3 |
|  Child 2 | 2 | 3 | 1 | 4 |
|  Child 3 | 3 | 1 | 2 | 4 |
|  Child 4 | 2 | 4 | 1 | 3 |
|  Child 5 | 3 | 4 | 2 | 1 |

$T_1 = 12$  
$T_2 = 13$  
$T_3 = 10$  
$T_4 = 15$  
$b = 5 \quad k = 4$  
$H_0$ : The four distributions are identical  
$H_a$ : At least one distribution is different  
$\alpha = 0.05$  
$F = \frac{12}{8*4\*5} \sum (12^2+13^2+10^2+15^2) - 3\*8\*5 =1.56$  
The rejection region is $\\{F: F > \chi^2_{0.05, 3}\\} = \\{F: F > 7.81473\\}$  
Since $1.56 < 7.81473$, $H_0$ is not rejected i.e. there is not significant evidence to indicate that at least one distribution is different.
