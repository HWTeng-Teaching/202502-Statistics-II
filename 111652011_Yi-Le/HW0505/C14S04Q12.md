## Solution

|           | Apartment | Duplex | Single Residence | Total |
|-----------|-----------|--------|------------------|-------|
|     1     | 8         | 20     | 1                | 29    |
|     2     | 16        | 8      | 9                | 33    |
|     3     | 10        | 10     | 14               | 34    |
|     4     | 6         | 2      | 16               | 24    |
| **Total** | 40        | 40     | 40               | 120   |


| Expected  | Apartment | Duplex | Single Residence | Total |
|-----------|-----------|--------|------------------|-------|
|     1     | 9.67      | 9.67   | 9.67             | 29    |
|     2     | 11        | 11     | 11               | 33    |
|     3     | 11.33     | 11.33  | 11.33            | 34    |
|     4     | 8         | 8      | 8                | 24    |
| **Total** | 40        | 40     | 40               | 120   |

$H_0$ : Family size is independent for residence type  
$H_a$ : Family size is dependent on residence type  

$$
\chi^2 = \frac{8^2 + 20^2 + 1^2}{9.67} + \frac{16^2 + 8^2 + 9^2}{11} + \frac{10^2 + 10^2 + 14^2}{11.33} + \frac{6^2 + 2^2 + 16^2}{8} -120 = 36.49
$$

$\alpha = 0.01 \quad df = 6$  
$\chi^2_{6, 0.01} = 16.812$  
Since $36.49 > 16.812$ , $H_0$ is rejected i.e. there is a significant difference in family size distributions among the three types of residence.
