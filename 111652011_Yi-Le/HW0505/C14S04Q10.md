## Solution

|                     | Yes | No  | Total |
|---------------------|-----|-----|-------|
| Bachelors or higher | 187 | 113 | 300   |
| Some college        | 162 | 138 | 300   |
| High school or less | 149 | 151 | 300   |
| **Total**           | 498 | 402 | 900   |

| Expected            | Yes | No  | Total |
|---------------------|-----|-----|-------|
| Bachelors or higher | 166 | 134 | 300   |
| Some college        | 166 | 134 | 300   |
| High school or less | 166 | 134 | 300   |
| **Total**           | 498 | 402 | 900   |

$H_0$ : Marital status is independent of educational level  
$H_a$ : Marital status is dependent on educational level

$$
\chi^2 = \frac{187^2 + 162^2 + 149^2}{166} + \frac{113^2 + 138^2 + 151^2}{134} - 900 = 10.06
$$

$\alpha = 0.05 \quad df = 2$  
$\chi^2_{2, 0.01} = 9.21$  
Since $10.06 > 9.21$ , $H_0$ is rejected i.e. there is sufficient evidence at the 1% level to conclude that marriage rates differ significantly among the three educational levels.
