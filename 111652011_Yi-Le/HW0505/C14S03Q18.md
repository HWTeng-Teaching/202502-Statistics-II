## Solution

|            | Small | Medium | Large | Total |
|------------|-------|--------|-------|-------|
| Fatal      | 67    | 26     | 16    | 109   |
| Not Fatal  | 128   | 63     | 46    | 237   |
| **Total**  | 195   | 89     | 62    | 346   |


| Expected   | Small | Medium | Large | Total |
|------------|-------|--------|-------|-------|
| Fatal      | 61.45 | 28.05  | 19.50 | 109   |
| Not Fatal  | 133.55| 60.95  | 42.50 | 237   |
| **Total**  | 195   | 89     | 62    | 346   |

$H_0$ : The occurrence of fatal accidents is independent of car size  
$H_a$ : The occurrence of fatal accidents is dependent on car size.

$$
\chi^2 = \frac{67^2}{61.45} + \frac{26^2}{28.05} + \frac{16^2}{19.50} + \frac{128^2}{133.55} + \frac{63^2}{60.95} + \frac{46^2}{42.50} - 346 = 1.87
$$

$\alpha = 0.05 \quad df = 2$  
$\chi^2_{2, 0.05} = 5.991$  
Since $1.87 < 5.991$ , $H_0$ is not rejected i.e. there is not sufficient evidence to suggest that the frequency of fatal accidents depends on the size of automobiles at the 5% significance level.
