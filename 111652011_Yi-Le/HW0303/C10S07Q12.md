## Solution

Define $D_i = X_{Ai} - X_{Bi}$

$D_1 = 3 - 4 = -1$

$D_2 = 1 - 2 = -1$

$D_3 = 1 - 3 = -2$

$D_4 = 2 - 1 = 1$

$D_5 = 1 - 2 = -1$

$D_6 = 2 - 3 = -1$

$D_7 = 3 - 3 = 0$

$D_8 = 2 - 3 = -1$

$n = 8 \quad \bar{d} = \frac{-1 - 1 - 2 + 1 - 1 - 1 + 0 - 1}{8} = -0.75 \quad s_D = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (D_i - \bar{D})^2}{n-1}} \approx 0.00953$

1. $H_0 : \mu_A - \mu_B = 0$  
$H_0 : \mu_A - \mu_B \neq 0$
2. Assume $\alpha = 0.05$
3. Find a test statistic and its sampling distribution:

$$
t_{STAT} = \frac{\bar{D} - 0}{S_D / \sqrt{N}} \sim t\_{(n-1)}
$$
  
4. The realized test statistic

$$
t^*= \frac{\bar{d} - 0}{S_D / \sqrt{n}} = \frac{-0.01 - 0}{0.00953 / \sqrt{6}} \approx -2.5703
$$

5. The critical value is $\pm t_{n - 1; \alpha / 2} = \pm t_{5; 0.025} = \pm 2.571.$  
Thus, the rejection region is $t < -2.571 \ or \ t > 2.571.$
6. Since $-2.571 < t = -2.5703 < 2.571$ , $H_0$ is not rejected i.e. there is no sufficient evidence to indicate a difference between the average densities of cakes prepared using two types of batter.
