## Solution of a

$\frac{larger\ s^2}{smaller\ s^2} = \frac{2.78095}{0.17143} \approx 16.22 > 3$

By the rule of Thumb, the equal assumption is not reasonable.

So we don't assume that the underlying variances are equal.

## Solution of b
Let Ethanol and Bleach be denoted by $E$ and $B$.
1. $H_0 : \mu_E - \mu_B = 0$  
$H_0 : \mu_E - \mu_B \neq 0$
2. Assume $\alpha = 0.05$
3. $t_{STAT} = \frac{(X_E - X_B) - (\mu_E - \mu_B)}{\sqrt{\frac{S_E^2}{n_E} + \frac{S_B^2}{n_B}}}
