## Solution
Let With Imagery and Without Imagery be denoted by $W$ and $N$.  

$$
n = 20 \quad \bar{d} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{20} (x_{Wi} - x_{Ni})}{20} = \frac{407 - 200}{20} = 10.25 \quad S_D = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{20} ((x_{Wi} - x_{Ni})-\bar{D})^2}{20-1}} \approx 4.0507
$$

1. $H_0 : \mu_W - \mu_N = 0$  
$H_0 : \mu_W - \mu_N > 0$
2. Assume $\alpha = 0.05$
3. Find a test statistic and its sampling distribution:

$$
t_{STAT} = \frac{\bar{D} - 0}{S_D / \sqrt{N}} \sim t\_{(n-1)}
$$
  
4. The realized test statistic

$$
t^*= \frac{\bar{d} - 0}{S_D / \sqrt{n}} = \frac{10.25 - 0}{4.0507 / \sqrt{20}} \approx 11.3164
$$

5. The critical value is $t_{n - 1; \alpha} = t_{19; 0.05} = 1.729.$  
Thus, the rejection region is $t > 1.729.$
6. Since $t = 11.3164 > 1.729$ , $H_0$ is rejected i.e. there is sufficient evidence to show that the average recall score is higher when imagery is used.
