There appears to be a positive linear relationship between armspan and height. In general, individuals with greater armspan tend to be taller. The values are relatively close in magnitude, suggesting a strong association and possibly even a 1:1 proportion in some cases. This aligns with commonly observed body proportions in humans.

#### b.

If a person's armspan is roughly the same as the person's height, the slope of the regression line should be near to 1.  

#### c.

$\hat{y} = a + bx$  

$$
S_{xy} = \sum xy - \frac{\sum x \sum y}{n}= 221414 - \frac{1328 \times 1331}{8} = 468
$$

$$
S_{xx} = \sum x^2 - \frac{(\sum x)^2}{n}= 221016 - \frac{1328^2}{8} = 568
$$

$$
b = \frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}} = \frac{468}{568} = 0.8239
$$

$$
a = \bar{y} - b\bar{x} = 29.6
$$

we find the least-squares regression line,

$\hat{y} = 29.6 + 0.8239x$  

#### d.

$\hat{y} = 29.6 + 0.8293 \times 157 = 158.95$  

a person with an armspan of 157 is predicted to have a height of 158.95
