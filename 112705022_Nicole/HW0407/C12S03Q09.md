As time increases, the miles of roadways generally increase, indicating a potential strong linear relationship. We could see a positive trend in the number of miles of roadways in the U.S. over 2000-2015.

#### b.

assume that year from 0-15 x and miles of roadways y are linearly related

$\hat{y} = a + bx$  

$$
S_{xy} = \sum xy - \frac{\sum x \sum y}{n}= 132.8 - \frac{120 \times 16.66}{16} = 7.85
$$

$$
S_{xx} = \sum x^2 - \frac{(\sum x)^2}{n}= 1240 - \frac{120^2}{16} = 340
$$

$$
b = \frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}} = \frac{7.85}{340} = 0.0231
$$

$$
a = \bar{y} - b\bar{x} = 1.04125 + 0.023 \times 7.5 = 0.8681
$$

we find the least-squares regression line,

$\hat{y} = 0.8681 + 0.0231x$  

to use t statistic, we need to know MSE, here we compute it

$$
TSS = S_{yy} = \sum y^2 - \frac{(\sum y)^2}{n} = 17.5336 - \frac{16.66^2}{5} = 0.186375
$$

$$
SSR = \frac{S_{xy}^2}{Syy} = \frac{7.85^2}{340} = 0.181243
$$

$$
SSE = 0.186375 - 0.181243 = 0.005132
$$

$$
MSE = \frac{SSE}{n-2} = \frac{0.005132}{14} = 0.000367
$$

test if the independent variable x is useful in predicting y

$H_0: \quad b = 0$  
$H_a: \quad b \neq 0$  

$\alpha = 0.05$  

use a t statistic

$$
t_{STAT} = \frac{b-0}{\sqrt{MSE/S_{xx}}} \sim t_{n-2}
$$

$$
t^* = \frac{b-0}{\sqrt{MSE/S_{xx}}} = \frac{0.0231}{\sqrt{0.000367/340}} = 7.031
$$

the critical value  

$$
t_{n-2, \alpha/2} = t_{14,0.025} = 2.145
$$

$\because 7.031 > 2.145$  

$\therefore reject \quad H_0$  

there is a linear relationship between the number of miles of roadways and the year

#### c.

the ANOVA table

| Source | df | SS | MS | F |
|:------|:------|:------|:------|:------|
| Regression | 1 | 0.181243 | 0.181243 | 493.85 |
| Error | 14 | 0.005132 | 0.000367 |  |
| Total | 15 | 0.186375 |  |  |

test if the independent variable x is useful in predicting y

$H_0: \quad b = 0$  
$H_a: \quad b \neq 0$  

$\alpha = 0.05$  

use the F statistic

$$
F_{STAT} = \frac{MSR}{MSE} \sim F_{1,n-2}
$$

$$
F_{1,14} = \frac{MSR}{MSE} = \frac{0.181243}{0.000367} = 493.85
$$

the critical value  

$$
F_{1,14,0.05} = 4.6001
$$

$\because 493.85 > 4.6001$  

$\therefore reject \quad H_0$  

there is a linear relationship between the number of miles of roadways and the year  

$t_{STAT}^2 = (\frac{b-0}{\sqrt{MSE/S_{xx}}})^2 = \frac{b^2}{MSE/S_{xx}} = \frac{b^2 S_{xx}}{MSE} = \frac{S_{xy}^2}{S_{xx}^2} \times \frac{S_{xx}}{MSE} = \frac{S_{xy}^2}{S_{xx} MSE} = \frac{SSR}{MSE} = \frac{SSR/1}{MSE} = \frac{MSR}{MSE} = F_{STAT}$  

we can verify that the square of the t statistic is equal to F statistic

### d.

$$
r^2 = \frac{SSR}{TSS} = \frac{0.181243}{0.186375} = 0.9725
$$

This means that 97.25% of the variation in the miles of roadways can be explained by the linear relationship with the year. This indicates a very strong fit of the regression model to the data.
