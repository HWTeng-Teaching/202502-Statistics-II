it is binomial distribution, each item is either defected or not  
when n is large to approximate infinite, the distribution would approximate normal distribution due to central limit theorem  
however, the data is 100 items selected from daily output recorded for 25 days, which is not a large amount, thus, whether the data is normal is not sure
