#### a.

$p-value = 0.0251 < 0.05$  
therefore, the data dose not indicate a significant difference in mean assembly times for people trained by the three programs

#### b.

construct a 99% CI for the difference in mean assembly times between persons trained by programs A and B

$$
\bar{x_{1\cdot}} - \bar{x_{2\cdot}} \pm t_{N-k, \alpha/2} \times \sqrt{MSE \times (\frac{1}{n_1}+\frac{1}{n_2})}
= \bar{x_{1\cdot}} - \bar{x_{2\cdot}} \pm t_{9, 0.005} \times \sqrt{MSE \times (\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{3})}
= 60.5 - 54.667 \pm 3.25 \times \sqrt{14.941 \times (\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{3})}
= (-3.7617, 15.4277)
$$

$\text{we have 0.99 confidence that interval constructing this way contains the difference between the two means}$  

#### c.

construct a 99% CI for the mean assembly times for persons trained by program A

$$
\bar{x_{1\cdot}} \pm t_{N-k, \alpha/2} \times \sqrt{\frac{MSE}{n_1}}
= \bar{x_{1\cdot}} \pm t_{9, 0.005} \times \sqrt{\frac{MSE}{4}}
= 60.5 \pm 3.25 \times \sqrt{\frac{14.941}{4}}
= (54.2188, 66.7182)
$$

$\text{we have 0.99 confidence that interval constructing this way contains the mean}$  

#### d.

we assume the data have been selected from normal population, and through the confidence interval we construct, it appears that none of the data is deviated from other data in the group, thus, I think the data will satisfy the assumption that they have been selected from normal populations
