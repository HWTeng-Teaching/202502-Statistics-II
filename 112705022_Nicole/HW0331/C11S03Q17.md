#### a.

treatment: stores
block: items

#### b.

$H_0: \quad \mu_1 = \mu_2 = \mu_3 = \mu_4$  
$H_a: \quad \exists \mu_i \neq \mu_j, i \neq j$  

to see if there are significant differences in prices from store to store  
we find

$F_{3,21,0.05} = 3.072$  

$\because 26.52 > 3.072$  
$\therefore reject \quad H_0$  

there is significant differences in prices from store to store

#### c.

to see if there are significant differences in prices from block to block  
we find  

$F_{7,21,0.05} = 2.488$  

$\because 35.32 > 2.488$  
$\therefore \text{there is significant differences from block to block  }$
