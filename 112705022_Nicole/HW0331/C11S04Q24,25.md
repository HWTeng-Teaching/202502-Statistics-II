#### a.

treatment: stores
block: items

#### b.

$H_0: \quad \mu_1 = \mu_2 = \mu_3 = \mu_4$  
$H_a: \quad \exists \mu_i \neq \mu_j, i \neq j$  

to see if there are significant differences in prices from store to store  
we find

$F_{3,21,0.05} = 3.072$  

$\because 26.52 > 3.072$  
$\therefore reject \quad H_0$  

there is significant differences in prices from store to store

#### c.

to see if there are significant differences in prices from block to block  
we find  

$F_{7,21,0.05} = 2.488$  

$\because 35.32 > 2.488$  
$\therefore \text{there is significant differences from block to block  }$

#### a. 

the appropriate value of $q_{\alpha}(k, df)$ for testing differences among stores

$$
q_{\alpha}(k, df) = q_{\alpha}(k, (k=1)(b-1)) = q_{0.05}(4, 21) = 3.942
$$

#### b.

computing $\omega$  

$$
\omega = q_{\alpha}(k, N-k) \times \sqrt{\frac{MSE}{n_t}}
= q_{0.05}(4, 21) \times \sqrt{\frac{0.1658}{8}}
= 5.19 \times \sqrt{\frac{0.1658}{8}}
= 0.7472
$$

#### c.

rank the population means and calculate the difference between them  
draw a line under the two populations that have difference smaller than $\omega$ computed

we can see that $\bar{x_2}$ differs significantly from the other three means $\bar{x_3}$, $\bar{x_1}$, and $\bar{x_4}$  
and $\bar{x_3}$ differs from $\bar{x_4}$
