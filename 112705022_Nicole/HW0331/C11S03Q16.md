use Tukey's method to make paired comparisons by the studentized range distribution  

$$
\omega = q_{\alpha}(k, N-k) \times \sqrt{\frac{MSE}{n_t}}
= q_{0.01}(4, 16) \times \sqrt{\frac{41.25}{5}}
= 5.19 \times \sqrt{\frac{41.25}{5}}
= 14.907
$$

rank the population means and calculate the difference between them  
draw a line under the two populations that have difference smaller than $\omega$ computed

we can see that $\bar{x_2}$ differs significantly from the other three means $\bar{x_3}$, $\bar{x_1}$, and $\bar{x_4}$  
and $\bar{x_3}$ differs from $\bar{x_4}$
