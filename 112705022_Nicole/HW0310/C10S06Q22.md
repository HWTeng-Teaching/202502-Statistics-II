### Q22  

#### a.  

$H_0: \sigma_1^2 = \sigma_2^2$  
$H_a: \sigma_1^2 \neq \sigma_2^2$  

set $\alpha$ = 0.05  

find a test statistic  

$F_{14,14} = \frac{2.96}{1.54} = 1.92$  

$p-value = 2 \times P(F_{14,14} > 1.92) = 2 \times 0.117295 = 0.235$  

the p-value is larger than $\alpha$, reject $H_0$  
there is sufficient evidence to indicate a difference between the variabilities of the closing prices of the two stocks for the populations associated with the two samples

#### b.  

construct a 99% CI

$(\frac{S_1^2}{S_2^2} \times \frac{1}{F_{n_1-1,n_2-1,0.005}}, \frac{S_1^2}{S_2^2} \times F_{n_2-1,n_1-1,0.005})$  
$(\frac{2.96}{1.54} \times \frac{1}{F{14,14,0.005}}, \frac{2.96}{1.54} \times F_{14,14,0.005}) = (0.45,8.26)$
