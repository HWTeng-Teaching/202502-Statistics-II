### Q16  

to test the assumption of equal variances using the F-test  

$F = \frac{S_1^2}{S_2^2}$  

set $\alpha$ = 0.05$  

find a test statistic  

$F_{14,14} = \frac{114^2}{103^2} = 1.22$  

$p-value = 2 \times P(F_{14,14} > 1.22) = 0.357503 \times 2 = 0.72$  

$\text{the p-value is larger than }\alpha\text{, therefore, non-reject }H_0$  
$\text{there is sufficient evidence to conclude that the variancies are not different, and the assumption of equal variancies is right}$
