### Q14

$H_0: \sigma_1^2 = \sigma_2^2$  
$H_a: \sigma_1^2 < \sigma_2^2$  

$set \alpha = 0.05$  

find a test statistic  

$F_{29,29} = \frac{15.6^2}{28.2^2} = 0.3060$  

$p-value = P(F_{29,29} < 0.3060) = 0.001048$  

$\text{the p-value is far smaller than }\alpha\text{, therefore, we reject }H_0$  
$\text{there is no sufficient evidence to conclude that the variability in daily production warrants increased maintenance of the older fabricating system}$
