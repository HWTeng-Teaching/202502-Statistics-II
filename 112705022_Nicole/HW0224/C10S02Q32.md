### Q32

#### a.

we are 95% confident that the mean is in the interval of (0.9867, 1.1178)

assume the significance leval $\alpha = 0.05$  

$\because$ p-value = 0.113 is smaller than 0.05  
$\therefore$ reject $H_0$ : $\mu = 1$  

there is no sufficient evidence that the mean weight differs from 1

#### b.

values of t

$t = \frac{\bar{x}-\mu}{s/\sqrt{n}} = \frac{1.0522-1}{0.1657/\sqrt{27}} \approx 1.64$  

UCL and LCL

$t_{26, 0.025} = 2.056$  
$SE = 0.0319$  
$UCL = 1.0522 + 2.056 \times 0.0319 \approx 1.1178$  
$UCL = 1.0522 - 2.056 \times 0.0319 \approx 0.9866$  

95% C.I. is (0.9866, 1.1178)
