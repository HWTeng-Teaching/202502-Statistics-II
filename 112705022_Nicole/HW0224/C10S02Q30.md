### Q30  
#### a.

$H_0$ : $\mu = 25$  
$H_a$ : $\mu \lt 25$  
set $\alpha = 0.05$  

$\bar{x} = 20.3$  
$s = 5$  
$n = 21$  

$t = \frac{\bar{x}-\mu}{s/\sqrt{n}} = \frac{20.3-25}{5/\sqrt{21}} \approx -4.308$  

$\because -t_{20, 0.05} = -1.725 \gt -4.308$  
$\therefore$ reject $H_0$  

there is sufficient evidence to conclude that the true pretreatment mean is less than 25

#### b.  

$\bar{x} = 26.6$  
$s = 7.4$  
$n = 21$  

$SE = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{7.4}{\sqrt{21}}$  

$t_{20, 0.025} = 2.086$  

construct a 95% C.I.  

$\bar{x} \pm t_{20, 0.025} \times SE = 26.6 \pm 2.086 \times \frac{7.4}{\sqrt{21}} \approx (23.232,\quad 29.968)$  

#### c.

the pretreatment mean is less than 25, and the postreatment and the follow-up sample mean are greater than 25  
meanwhile, the postreatment and the follow-up sample mean are approximately the same
