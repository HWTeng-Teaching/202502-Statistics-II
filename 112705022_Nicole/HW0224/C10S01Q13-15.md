### Q13
Since the data closely follows a straight line, it suggests that the data is approximately normally distributed.

### Q14
Some points stray far away from the line. The data does not follow linearity which indicates its non-normality.

### Q15
The boxplot is symmetric, the median is near the center of the box, and the whiskers are approximately the same length. Therefore, the data is approximately normally distributed.
