### Q20
$\mu = 74$  
$\bar{x} = 69.7$  
$n = 25$  
$s = 16$  
$\alpha = 0.05$  

$H_0$ : $\mu = 74$  
$H_a$ : $\mu \neq 74$    
$\alpha = 0.05$  

$t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{s/ \sqrt{n}} = \frac{69.7-74}{16/\sqrt{25}} \approx -1.343$  

$\because -t_{24,0.025} = -2.064 \lt -1.343$  
$\therefore$ non-reject $H_0$  

there is no sufficient evidence to say that the CBF for stroke patients is different fom that of healthy people
