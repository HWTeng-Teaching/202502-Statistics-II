#### a.

we should use correlation analysis, because when a sample of n individuals is selected and two variables are measured on each individual, the correlation coefficient r is appropriate to use  
in the question we have, calories and total fat of the 7 ice cream flavor is measured, which is suitable to use the correlation analysis  

#### b.

total fat as independent variable, x, and calories as dependent variable, y  

$$
r = 0.9190
$$

$H_0: \quad \rho = 0$  
$H_a: \quad \rho \neq 0$  

$\alpha = 0.05$  

use the t statistic  

$$
t_{STAT} = r \times \sqrt{\frac{n-2}{1-r^2}} \sim t_{n-2}
$$

$$
t^* = 0.9190 \times \sqrt{\frac{5}{1-0.9190^2}} = 5.2122
$$

the critical value  

$$
t_{5,0.025} = 2.571
$$

$\because 5.2122 > 2.571$  

$\therefore reject \quad H_0$  

there is sufficient evidence to indicate that there is correlation between total fat and calories
