#### a.

only 2.7% of the variation in TV price is explained by screen size, which shows a eak relationship  

#### b.

In the normal probability plot, the residuals donâ€™t closely follow the straight line, this suggests the normality assumption may be violated. In the residuals versus fitted value plot, there is non-constant spread of residuals which indicates violation of equal variance assumption.   
Both the normality and equal variance assumptions appear violated.  \

#### c.

the key violated assumption is: linearity  
the relationship between screen size and price does not appear linear
