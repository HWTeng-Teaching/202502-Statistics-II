#### a.

(1) The relationship between the independent variable x and the dependent variable y is linear. $y = \alpha + \beta x + \epsilon$  
(2) The values of random error term $\epsilon$ are independent.  
(3) The random errors have a mean of 0, and a constant variance $\sigma^2$.  
(4) The random errors should be normally distributed.  

#### b.

the best estimate of $\sigma^2$ is 58.05, as shown in the table  

#### c.

In the normal probability plot, there are deviations in the tails, so the residuals are showing non-normality, which is not valid of the normal distribution assumption.  
In the residuals versus fits plot, the points do not scatter randomly around y = 0. It violates the assumption of equal variances.
