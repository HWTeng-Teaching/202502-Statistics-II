### Q22

#### a. 

paired data

d = Batter B - Batter A  

$d_1 = -0.006 \quad d_2 = 0.018 \quad d_3 = 0.014 \quad d_4 = 0.011 \quad d_5 = 0.004 \quad d_6 = 0.019$  

$\bar{d} = 0.01$  
$S_d = 0.00953$  

$H_0: \mu = 0$  
$H_a: \mu \neq 0$  

$\alpha = 0.05$  

test statistic  

$t_5 = \frac{\bar{d} - 0}{S_d / \sqrt{n}} = \frac{0.01}{0.00953/ \sqrt{6}} = 2.570$  
$\because t_{5, 0.025} = 2.571 \gt 2.570$  
$\therefore non-reject H_0$  

there is no sufficient evidence to indicate a difference between the average densities of cakes prepared using the two types of batter  

#### b.  

$\bar{d} \pm t_{5, 0.025} \times \frac{S_c}{\sqrt{n}} = 0.01 \pm 2.571 \times \frac{0.00953}{\sqrt{6}} = (-0.0000027,0.020)$
