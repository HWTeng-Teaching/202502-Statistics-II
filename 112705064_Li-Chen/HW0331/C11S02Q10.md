## Solution
### (a)
1. $H_0: \mu_A = \mu_B = \mu_c \quad \quad H_a:$ at least one mean is different   
  
2. Set $\alpha = 0.01$  
  
3. test statistic and its sampling distribution

$$
F_{\text{STAT}} = \frac{MST}{MSE} \sim F_{(k-1),(n-k) = 2,9}
$$

4. the realized statistic

$$
F^* = 5.704
$$

5. The $p-value = P(F_{2,9} > F^*) = 0.0251$  
  
6. Because $p-value = 0.0251 > \alpha = 0.01$ , $H_0$ is not rejected, which means that there is no significant difference in mean assembly times for people trained by the three programs.

### (b)

99% CI for the difference in means of A and B ($\mu_A-\mu_B$):

$$
99\\% CI = (\bar{x}_A - \bar{x}_B) \pm t\_{0.01/2;9} * \sqrt{MSE*(\frac{1}{n_A} + \frac{1}{n_B})}
$$

$$
99\\% CI = (60.5- 54.667) \pm 3.250 * \sqrt{14.941*(\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{3})}
$$

$$
99\\% CI = (-3.7617 , 15.4277)
$$

### (c)

99% CI for the mean of A ($\mu_A$):

$$
99\\% CI = \bar{x}_A \pm t\_{0.01/2;4-1} * \frac{s_A}{\sqrt{n_A}}
$$

$$
99\\% CI = 60.5 \pm 5.841 * \sqrt{\frac{9.667}{4}}
$$

$$
99\\% CI = (51.4196, 69.5804)
$$

### (d)
Because in each group, there is no extreme outliers and the shape of the data looks not heavily skewed and reasonably symmetric, we may say that the data have been selected from normal populations.
