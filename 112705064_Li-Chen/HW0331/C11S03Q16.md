## Solution
$\omega = q_{\alpha}(k,df) * \sqrt{\frac{MSE}{n_i}} = q_{0.01}(4,16) * \sqrt{\frac{41.25}{5}} = 5.19 * \sqrt{\frac{41.25}{5}} \approx 14.9071$   
$| \bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2 | = 27.4 > \omega \Rightarrow \mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ is significantly different.  
$| \bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_3 | = 10.6 < \omega \Rightarrow \mu_1$ and $\mu_3$ is no significantly different.  
$| \bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_4 | = 6.4 < \omega \Rightarrow \mu_1$ and $\mu_4$ is no significantly different.  
$| \bar{x}_2 - \bar{x}_3 | = 16.8 > \omega \Rightarrow \mu_2$ and $\mu_3$ is significantly different.  
$| \bar{x}_2 - \bar{x}_4 | = 33.8 > \omega \Rightarrow \mu_2$ and $\mu_4$ is significantly different.  
$| \bar{x}_3 - \bar{x}_4 | = 17 > \omega \Rightarrow \mu_3$ and $\mu_4$ is significantly different.
