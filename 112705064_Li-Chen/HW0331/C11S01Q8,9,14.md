## Solution
### 8.
factor: type of fertilizers.  
levels: type A of fertilizer, type B of fertilizer, type C of fertilizer.  
treatments: type A of fertilizer, type B of fertilizer, type C of fertilizer  

### 9.
factor: daily dose of vitamin C.  
levels: 200 mg, 500 mg, 1000 mg.  
treatments: daily dose of vitamin C at 200 mg, daily dose of vitamin C at 500 mg, daily dose of vitamin C at 1000 mg.  

### 14.
we are willing to assume the data is normal because  
1. The sample size of 25 days could be considered sufficiently large. Then we can use C.L.T to approach a normal distribution.
2. If the  proportion of defective items is not too close to 0 or 1, we assume it is normal. Because proportions often follow a binomial distribution, and as the sample size grows, this binomial distribution tends to become symmetric and bell-shaped.
  
we are not willing to assume the data is normal because
1. If the  proportion of defective items is too close to 0 or 1, it is more probably that the data is not normal.
