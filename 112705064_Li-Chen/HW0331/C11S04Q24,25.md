## Solution of questoin 24
### (a)
  
blocks: items  
treatments: stores  
  
### (b)
1. $H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2 = \mu_3 = \mu_4 \quad \quad H_a:$ at least one mean is different   
  
2. Set $\alpha = 0.05$  
  
3. test statistic and its sampling distribution

$$
F_{\text{STAT}} = \frac{MST}{MSE} \sim F_{(k-1),(k-1)(b-1) = 3,21}
$$

4. the realized statistic

$$
F^* = 26.52
$$

5. The rejection region, $RR = \\{ F : F>F_{3,21;0.05} \\} = \\{ F : F>3.07 \\}$  
  
6. Because $F = 26.52$ falls into the rejection region, $H_0$ is rejected, which means that there is significant difference in prices from store to store.  

### (c)
1. $H_0: \mu_A = \mu_B = ... = \mu_H \quad \quad H_a:$ at least one mean is different   
  
2. Set $\alpha = 0.05$  
  
3. test statistic and its sampling distribution

$$
F_{\text{STAT}} = \frac{MST}{MSE} \sim F_{(b-1),(k-1)(b-1) = 7,21}
$$

4. the realized statistic

$$
F^* = 35.32
$$

5. The rejection region, $RR = \\{ F : F>F_{7,21;0.05} \\} = \\{ F : F>2.4876 \\}$  
  
6. Because $F = 35.32$ falls into the rejection region, $H_0$ is rejected, which means that there is significant difference from block to block.  
   blocking is effective.

## Solution of questoin 25
### (a)
$q_{0.05}(k,df) = q_{0.05}(4,21) = 3.942$

### (b)
$\omega = q_{0.05}(k,df) * \sqrt{\frac{MSE}{b}} = 3.942 * \sqrt{0.1658}{8} \approx 0.5675$

### (c)
$|\bar{T}_1 - \bar{T}_2| = 0.4875 < \omega \Rightarrow \mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ is no significantly different.   
$|\bar{T}_1 - \bar{T}_3| = 0.205 < \omega \Rightarrow \mu_1$ and $\mu_3$ is no significantly different.   
$|\bar{T}_1 - \bar{T}_4| = 1.65875 > \omega \Rightarrow \mu_1$ and $\mu_4$ is significantly different.  
$|\bar{T}_2 - \bar{T}_3| = 0.2825 < \omega \Rightarrow \mu_2$ and $\mu_3$ is no significantly different.   
$|\bar{T}_2 - \bar{T}_4| = 1.17125 > \omega \Rightarrow \mu_2$ and $\mu_4$ is significantly different.   
$|\bar{T}_3 - \bar{T}_4| = 1.45375 > \omega \Rightarrow \mu_3$ and $\mu_4$ is significantly different.   
  
To sum up, WinCo store differs significantly from the others in average prices of the selected items
