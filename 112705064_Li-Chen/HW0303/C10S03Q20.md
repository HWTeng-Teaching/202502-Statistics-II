## Solution
define:  
$\bar{X}_A$ : mean of river water at a location above the town  
$S_A$ : sample standard deviation of river water at a location above the town  
$n_A$ : sample size of river water at a location above the town  
$\sigma_A$ : standard deviation of river water at a location above the town  
  
$\bar{X}\_B$ : mean of river water at a location below the town    
$S\_B$ : sample standard deviation of river water at a location below the town   
$n\_B$ : sample size of river water at a location below the town   
$\sigma\_B$ : standard deviation of river water at a location below the town   
  
$n\_A = 5 \quad \bar{x} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{5} X_{Ai}}{5} = 5 \quad \quad s_A^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{5} (x_{Ai} - \bar{x}_A)^2}{5-1} = 0.025$  

$n\_B = 5 \quad \bar{x} = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^{5} X_{Bj}}{5} = 4.86 \quad \quad s_B^2 = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^{5} (x_{Bj} - \bar{x}_B)^2}{5-1} = 0.013$  

$\because \quad \frac{s_A^2}{s_B^2} \approx 1.9231 \leq 3$  
$\therefore \quad$ we assume $\sigma_A = \sigma_B$.  
  
The common variance($s$)  

$$
s^2 = \frac{(n_A-1)s_A^2 + (n_B-1)s_B^2}{n_A+n_B-2} = \frac{(5-1)*0.025 + (5-1)*0.013}{5+5-2} = 0.019
$$  
  
### (a)  
1. $H_0:\mu_A-\mu_B = 0 \quad \quad H_a:\mu_A-\mu_B > 0$

2. $\alpha$ is given by the question. $\alpha = 0.05$

3. The test statistic and its sampling distribution

$$
t_{\text{STAT}} = \frac{(\bar{X}_A - \bar{X}_B) -0}{\sqrt{S^2 * (\frac{1}{n_A} + \frac{1}{n_B}})} \sim t\_{(n_A+n_B-2)=8}
$$

4. The realized statitic

$$
t^*= \frac{(\bar{x}_A - \bar{x}_B) -0}{\sqrt{s^2 * (\frac{1}{n_A} + \frac{1}{n_B}})} = \frac{(5 - 4.86) -0}{\sqrt{0.019 * (\frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{5}})} \approx 1.6059
$$

5. The critical value is $t_{\alpha} = t_{0.05} = 1.860$.  
   Therefore, the rejection region is { $t$ : $t>1.860$}.  
  
6. Because $t=1.6059$ does not fall into the rejection region, $H_0$ is not rejected, which means there is no sufficient evidence to show that the mean oxygen content below the town is less than the mean oxygen content above.

### (b)  
The 95% confidence interval is

$$
95\\% CI = (\bar{x}_A - \bar{x}_B) \pm t\_{8;0.025} * \sqrt{s^2*(\frac{1}{n_A}+\frac{1}{n_B})}
$$

$$
95\\% CI = (5 - 4.86) \pm 2.306 * \sqrt{0.019*(\frac{1}{5}+\frac{1}{5})}
$$

$$
95\\% CI \approx (-0.0610, 0.3410)
$$
