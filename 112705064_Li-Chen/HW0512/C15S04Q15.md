## Solution

### (a) 
The paired-difference test(parametric), the Wilcoxon signed-rank test(nonparametric), and the sign test can be used to test for differences in the distribution of recall scores with and without imagery.  

The assumptions are required for the paired-difference test:  
1. Each observation in one group must be uniquely matched to an observation in the other group.
2. The differences between each pair are independent of the differences in other pairs.
3. The distribution of the differences should be normal distribution.

These data satisfy that each observation in one group must be uniquely matched to an observation in the other group and the differences between each pair are independent of the differences in other pairs.  
These data do not satisfy the normal distribution assumption, since there are some data that are extreme values and the shape of the data does not looks like bell-shape.  

### (b)
|Pair| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7  | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11| 12| 13| 14| 15| 16| 17| 18| 19| 20|
|:--:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-: |:-:|:-:|:-: |:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|A-B | 15| 15| 15| 9 | 16| 8 | 12 | 8 | 10| 12 | 9 | 4 | 10| 4 | 17| 13| 4 | 7 | 7 | 10|
|rank| 17| 17| 17|8.5| 19|6.5|13.5|6.5| 11|13.5|8.5| 2 | 11| 2 | 20| 15| 2 |4.5|4.5| 11|

The Sign Test:  
  
1. $H_0 : p=0.5 \quad \quad H_a : p \neq 0.5$  
   
2. $\alpha = 0.05$  
    
3. test statistic: $x = \\#(+) , n=20$  
  
4. realized statistic: $x=20$  
  
5. $p-value = 2*P(x \geq 20) = 2\* (1 - P(x \leq 19)) = 0 < \alpha = 0.05$  

6. Because $p-value = 0 < \alpha$, $H_0$ is rejected, which means that there is significant difference in the distributions of recall scores under these two conditions.

The Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test:  

$\quad T^+ = 210$  
  
$\quad T^- = 0$  
  
1. $H_0 : p=0.5 \quad \quad H_a : p \neq 0.5$  
   
2. $\alpha = 0.05$  
    
3. test statistic: $T = min(T^+, T^-) , n=20$  
  
4. realized statistic: $T = min(T^+, T^-) = min(210,0) = 0$  
  
5. $\text{Rejection region: } \\{T | T \leq 52 \\}$    
  
6. Because $T=0 < 52$, $H_0$ is rejected, which means that there is significant difference in the distributions of recall scores under these two conditions.  

### (c)
Yes, they have the same results.
