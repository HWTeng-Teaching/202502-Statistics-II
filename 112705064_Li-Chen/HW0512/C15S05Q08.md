## Soluiton

### (a)
rank:
|10~19|20~39|40~59|60~69|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 21  |  8  | 39  |  18 |
| 29.5|  15 | 10.5|  21 |
| 12.5|29.5 | 5.5 |  34 |
| 15  |  24 | 29.5| 37.5|
| 40  |  3  | 18  |  3  |
| 36  |  18 | 12.5|  1  |
| 29.5|  8  | 23  | 10.5|
| 21  |  34 | 34  |  8  |
| 37.5|   3 | 15  | 29.5|
| 5.5 | 25.5| 29.5| 25.5|

$T_1 = 21 + 29.5 + 12.5 + 15 + 40 + 36 + 29.5 + 21 + 37.5 + 5.5 = 247.5$  
  
$T_2 = 8 + 15 + 29.5 + 24 + 3 + 18 + 8 + 34 + 3 + 25.5 = 168$  
  
$T_3 = 39 + 10.5 + 5.5 + 29.5 + 18 + 12.5 + 23 + 34 + 15 + 29.5 = 216.5$   
  
$T_4 = 18 + 21 + 34 + 37.5 + 3 + 1 + 10.5 + 8 + 29.5 + 25.5 = 188$  
  
$n=40$  
  
1. $H_0$: 4 distributions are identical  
   $H_a$: at least one distribution is different  

2. $\alpha = 0.01$

3. test statistic:

$$
H_{STAT} = \frac{12}{n(n+1)} \sum \frac{T_i^2}{n_i} - 3(n+1) \sim \chi^2_{(k-1)=(4-1)=3}
$$

4. realized staistic:

$$
H^* = \frac{12}{20(20+1)} \* (\frac{247.5^2}{10} + \frac{168^2}{10} + \frac{216.5^2}{10} + \frac{188^2}{10}) - 3(40+1) \approx 2.6316
$$

5. Rejection region, RR = $\\{ \chi^2 | \chi^2 >\chi^2_{3;0.01} \\} = \\{ \chi^2 | \chi^2 >11.3449 \\}$

6. Because $\chi^2 = 2.6316$ does not fall into the rejection region, $H_0$ is not rejected, which means that there is no sufficient evidence to indicate differences in location for at least two of the four age groups.

### (b) 
$p-value = P(\chi^2 > 2.6316) \approx 0.452$  

### (c)
For the F-test, the rejection region is $\\{ F | F > F_{(k-1),(n-k) = (4-1),(40-4) = 3,36}\\} = \\{ F | F > 4.3771\\}$  

Because $F = 0.87$ does not fall into the rejection region, $H_0$ is not rejected.  

The test results from the F-test and the H-test are the same.  

The two tests both have the p-values that do not reject $H_0$, and their p-values are very close.  
  
The implications of the comparison are that:  

Because the p-values are very close, the data may not have severely violated the assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variances, or the two methods may both have detected a little differences between the groups.
