## Solution

### (a)
|Pair| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4  | 5 | 6 | 7 |
|:--:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-: |:-:|:-:|:-:|
|1-2 |0.1|0.7|0.3|-0.1|0.5|0.2|0.5|
|rank|1.5| 7 | 4 |1.5 |5.5| 3 |5.5|
  
$T^+ = 1.5 + 7 + 4 + 5.5 + 3 + 5.5 = 26.5$  
  
$T^- = 1.5$  
  
1. $H_0 : p=0.5 \quad \quad H_a : p \neq 0.5$  
   
2. $\alpha = 0.1$  
    
3. test statistic: $T = min(T^+, T^-) , n=7$  
  
4. realized statistic: $T = min(T^+, T^-) = min(26.5,1.5) = 1.5$  
  
5. $\text{Rejection region: } \\{T | T \leq 4 \\}$    
  
6. Because $T=1.5 < 4$, $H_0$ is rejected, which means that there is significant difference between the two populations.

### (b)
The result of the exercise 4 is not to reject $H_0$. The results of the two tests are different.  

The sign test only consider the sign and ignores the rank. On the other hand, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test consider the sign and the rank, providing more information and being more sensitive to detect differences.  
Therefore, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test is more powerful than the sign test.  
If the sign test fails to reject $H_0$ , the Wilcoxon signed-rank test can be used to further test the hypothesis.
