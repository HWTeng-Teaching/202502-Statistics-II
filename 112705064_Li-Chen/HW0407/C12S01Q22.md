## Solution
### (a)
The data shows an upward trend. If the one increases, and the other would be also increaseing.  
Therefore, the two variables have a positive correlation.

### (b)
If a person's armspan is roughly the same as the person's height, the slope of the regression line would be upward and positive, showing that they are positive correlation.

### (c)

$\hat{y} = a + bx$  
$\sum x_iy_i = 221414 \quad \quad \bar{x} = 166 \quad \quad \bar{y}=166.375 \quad \quad n=8$  
$\sum x_i^2 = 221016 \quad \quad \bar{x}^2 = 27556$  

$$
b = \frac{\sum x_iy_i - n \bar{x} \bar{y}}{\sum x_i^2 - n \bar{x}^2} = \frac{221414-8*166\*166.375}{221016-8\*27556} \approx 0.8239
$$

$$
a = \bar{y} - b \bar{x} = 166.375 - 0.8239*166 = 29.6076
$$

the least-squares regression line is

$$
\hat{y} = a + bx \Rightarrow \hat{y} = 29.6076 + 0.8239x
$$

$b=0.8239$ is positive, confirming my conclusion in part (b).

### (d)

$$
\hat{y} = 29.6076 + 0.8239x
$$
$$
\hat{y} = 29.6076 + 0.8239*157 \approx 158.96
$$

The person's height is predicted to be approximately 158.96.
