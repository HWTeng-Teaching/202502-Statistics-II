## Solution
### (a)
According to the table, $b = -1.251 \quad \qaud a = 93.617$  
$\hat{y} = a + bx \Rightarrow \hat{y} = 93.617 - 1.251x$  

### (b)
1. $H_0: \beta = 0 \quad \quad H_a: \beta \neq 0$  
  
2. $\text{Set } \alpha = 0.05$  
  
3. The test statistic and its sampling distribution

$$
t_{\text{STAT}} = \frac{b-0}{MSE/S_{xx}} \sim t_{(n-2)=5}
$$

4. The realized statistic

$$
t^* = -10.471
$$

5. $RR = \\{t : t>t_{5;0.025} \text{ or } t<-t_{5;0.025} \\}= \\{t: t>2.571 \text{ or } t<-2.571 \\}$
  
6. Because $t=-10.471$ falls into the rejection region, $H_0$ is rejected, which means the data provides sufficient evidence to indicate that x and y are linearly related.

### (c)
95% CI for the slope of the line:  
the lower limit is given by the table: $-1.559$  
the upper limit $= b + t_{5,0.025} * sqrt{\frac{MSE}{S_{xx}}} = -1.251 + 2.571 *ã€€0.12 \approx -0.942$  
standard error of b $=sqrt{\frac{MSE}{S_{xx}} = 0.12$  

### (d)
$R^2 = 0.9564$  
That is, about 97.23% of the variability in the percentage arrested can be explained by the linear relationship with group median age. $r^2=0.9723$ indicates a very effective linear regression model.
