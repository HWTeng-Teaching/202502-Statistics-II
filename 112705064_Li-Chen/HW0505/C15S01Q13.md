## Solution
$n_1 = 9 \quad \quad n_2 = 9$

1. $H_0$ : the two population distributions are the same  
   $H_a$ : the two population distributions are in some way different

2. Set $\alpha=0.05$

3. test statistic

$$
T_{STAT} = min(T_1,T_1^*)
$$

4. realized statistic: $T^* = min(45,126) = 45$

5. Rejection region, $RR = \\{ T : T \leq T_{0.025}\\} = \\{ T : T \leq 62 \\}$

6. Because $T=45$ falls into the rejection region, $H_0$ is rejected, which means that the distributions of eye-movement rates for deaf children and hearing children differ.
