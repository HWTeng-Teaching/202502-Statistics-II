## Question

When using rule of thumb to check if two variances
<br>
are the same, approximate the significance level with $n_1=4$ and $n_2=3$.

## Solution

Rule of Thumb:

$$
\frac{S_1^2}{S_2^2} \leq 3
$$

where $S_1$ is the larger one, $S_2$ is the smaller one.  
  
Set the significance level is $\alpha$.  

$df_1 = 4-1 = 3 \quad \quad df_2 = 3-1 = 2$  

$$
P\[F>F_{3,2,\alpha}\] = \alpha ,\quad  and \quad set \quad F_{3,2,\alpha} = 3
$$

$$
P\[F>3] \approx 0.2599 = \alpha
$$

Therefore, the approximate significance level is 0.2599.
