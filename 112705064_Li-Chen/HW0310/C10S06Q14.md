## Solution

$\quad n_1=30 \quad n_2=30$  
  
1. $H_0: \frac{\sigma_2^2}{\sigma_1^2} = 1 \quad H_a: \frac{\sigma_2^2}{\sigma_1^2} > 1$

2. Set $\alpha = 0.05$.

3. The test statistic and its sampling distribution

$$
F_{\text{STAT}} = \frac{S_2^2}{S_1^2} \sim F_{(n_2-1),(n_1-1) \Rightarrow 29,29}
$$

4. The realized statistic

$$
F^* = \frac{28.2^2}{15.6^2} = \frac{795.24}{243.36} \approx 3.2678
$$
  
5. $p-value = P\[F>3.2678\] \approx 0.00105$

6. Because $p-value < \alpha = 0.05$, $H_0$ is rejected, which means there is sufficient evidence to show that the older fabricating system has higher variability in daily production than the newer system. This suggests that increased maintenance might be warranted for the older system.
