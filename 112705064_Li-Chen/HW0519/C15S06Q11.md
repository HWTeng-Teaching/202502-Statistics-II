## Solution
### (a)
|rank| B1| B2| B3| B4| B5| B6|
|:--:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| T1 | 4 | 1 | 2 | 5 | 6 | 3 |
| T2 | 1 | 4 | 2 | 3 | 6 | 5 |
| T3 |5.5| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |5.5|
| T4 | 2 | 4 | 2 | 5 | 6 | 3 |
| T5 | 5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 6 | 4 |
  
$T_1 = 18 \quad \quad T_2 = 12 \quad \quad T_3 = 26 \quad \quad T_4 = 27 \quad \quad T_5 = 7$  

$b = 6 \quad \quad k=5$  
  
1. $H_0$ : The 5 distributions are identical $\quad \quad H_a$ : at least one distribution is different

2. $\alpha = 0.05$

3. test statistic

$$
F_{r,STAT} = \frac{12}{bk(k+1)} \sum T_i^2 - 3b(k+1) \sim \chi^2_{(k-1)=4}
$$

4. realized statistic

$$
F_r^* = \frac{12}{6*5\*6} \sum (18^2+12^2+26^2+27^2+7^2) - 3\*6\*5 = 38.1333
$$

5. rejection region, RR = $\\{F_r: F_r > \chi^2_{0.05;4}\\} = \\{F_r: F_r > 9.48773\\}$

6. Because $F_r=38.1333$ falls into the rejection region, $H_0$ is rejected, which means the data provide sufficient evidence to indicate a difference in the yields for the five different varieties of wheat.


### (b)
The rejection region, RR = $\\{F: F > F_{(5-1),(5-1)(6-1);0.05}\\} = \\{F: F > 2.87\\}$  
Because $F=18.61$ falls into the rejection region, $H_0$ is rejected, which means the data provide sufficient evidence to indicate a difference in the yields for the five different varieties of wheat.  
The result is the same with the result of part (a). This indicate that the data show a significant difference in the yields for the five different varieties of wheat, regardless of whether the data itself follows a normal distribution.
