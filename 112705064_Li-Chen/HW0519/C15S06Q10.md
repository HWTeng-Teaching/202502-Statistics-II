## Solution

### (a)
The randomized block design is used in collecting these data. Each of five children was asked to taste each of four antibiotics, 


### (b)

### (c)
nonparametric randomized block design test: Friedman $F_r$ -test  
|rank| T1| T2| T3| T4|
|:--:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| B1 | 2 | 1 | 4 | 3 |
| B2 | 2 | 3 | 1 | 4 |
| B3 | 3 | 1 | 2 | 4 |
| B4 | 2 | 4 | 1 | 3 |
| B5 | 3 | 4 | 2 | 1 |

$T_1 = 12 \quad \quad T_2 = 13 \quad \quad T_3 = 10 \quad \quad T_4 = 15$  

$b = 5 \quad \quad k=4$  
  
1. $H_0$ : The 4 distributions are identical $\quad \quad H_a$ : at least one distribution is different

2. $\alpha = 0.05$

3. test statistic

$$
F_{r,STAT} = \frac{12}{bk(k+1)} \sum T_i^2 - 3b(k+1) \sim \chi^2_{(k-1)=3}
$$

4. realized statistic

$$
F_r^* = \frac{12}{8*4\*5} \sum (12^2+13^2+10^2+15^2) - 3\*8\*5 =1.56
$$

5. rejection region, RR = $\\{F_r: F_r > \chi^2_{0.05;3}\\} = \\{F_r: F_r > 7.81473\\}$

6. Because $F_r=1.56$ does not fall into the rejection region, $H_0$ is not rejected, which means that there is no significant difference in the distributions of reponses to the tastes of the four antibiotics.
