## a. ANOVA Table  

| Source     | DF  | Adj SS | Adj MS | F-Value |
|------------|----|--------|--------|---------|
| Varieties  | 3  | 0.922  | 0.307  | 1.49   |
| Error      | 33 | 6.811   | 0.206  |         |
| **Total**  | 36 | 7.733  |        |         |

## b. Hypothesis Test for Significant Difference   

- **Null Hypothesis**:  
  $$H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2 = \mu_3 = \mu_4$$  
- **Alternative Hypothesis**:  
  $$H_a: \text{At least one mean is different}$$  
- **Significance Levels**:  
  $$\alpha = 0.05$$  
  $$\alpha = 0.01$$  

We reject $H_0$ if: $F > F_{\alpha,3,33}$

From the ANOVA table:  
$$F = 1.49$$  

For $\alpha = 0.05$, the critical value: $F_{0.05,3,33} = 2.89$  
Since $1.490 < 2.89$, we **fail to reject** $H_0$.  

For $\alpha = 0.01$, the critical value: $F_{0.01,3,33} = 4.44$  

Since $1.490 < 4.44$, we **fail to reject** $H_0$.  

### Conclusion:  
There is no significant difference in average price among the tuna varieties at both $\alpha = 0.05$ and $\alpha = 0.01$.

## c. 95% C.I. for the Price Difference Between Light Tuna in Water and Light Tuna in Oil  

Given:  
- $$s = \sqrt{MSE}= \sqrt{0.206} = 0.453$$  
- $$n_1 = 14, \quad n_4 = 11$$  
- $$\bar{x}_1 = 0.896, \quad \bar{x}_4 = 1.147$$  

Confidence Interval formula:  

$$
(0.896 - 1.147) \pm 2.035 \times 0.453 \times \sqrt{\frac{1}{14} + \frac{1}{11}}
$$  

$$
-0.251 \pm 0.371
$$  

$$
(-0.622, 0.12)
$$  

### Conclusion:  
The confidence interval contains 0, so there is no significant difference between the prices of light tuna in water and light tuna in oil.

## d. 95% C.I. for the Price Difference Between White Tuna in Water and White Tuna in Oil  

Given:  
- $$s = \sqrt{MSE} = 0.453$$  
- $$n_2 = 8, \quad n_3 = 4$$  
- $$\bar{x}_2 = 1.28, \quad \bar{x}_3 = 1.225$$  

Confidence Interval formula:  

$$
(1.28 - 1.225) \pm 2.035 \times 0.453 \times \sqrt{\frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{4}}
$$  

$$
0.055 \pm 0.565
$$  

$$
(-0.51, 0.62)
$$  

### Conclusion:  
Since the confidence interval includes 0, there is no significant difference between the prices of white tuna in water and white tuna in oil.

## e. Other Confidence Intervals of Interest  

Other possible confidence intervals that might be of interest to the researcher:  

- **Light tuna in water vs. White tuna in water** $$(\mu_1 - \mu_2)$$  
- **Light tuna in oil vs. White tuna in oil** $$(\mu_4 - \mu_3)$$  
- **Pairwise comparisons of any two tuna types**  

These follow the same procedure as in c and d.
