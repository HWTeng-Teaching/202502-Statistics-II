$$
s = \sqrt{MSE} = \sqrt{41.25} = 6.422
$$

$$
SE = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n_i}} = \frac{6.422}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{6.422}{2.236} = 2.872
$$



$$
q_{0.01}(4, 16) \approx 5.19
$$

---

$$
\omega = q \cdot SE = 5.19 \times 2.872 = 14.906
$$

Now compute absolute differences between sample means:

$$
\bar{x}_2 < \bar{x}_3 < \bar{x}_1 < \bar{x}_4
$$

$$
|251.6 - 234.8 | = 16.8 
$$
$$
|262.2 - 251.6| = 10.6 
$$
$$
|268.6 - 262.2| = 6.4 
$$



Compare each to $\omega = 14.906$:

**state 2** is significantly different from all other.
**state 3** is significantly different from the mean cost in **state 4**.
