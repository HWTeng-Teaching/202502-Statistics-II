## **a. ANOVA Table**  

| Source   | DF  | Adj SS  | Adj MS  | F-Value |
|----------|---- |--------|--------|---------|
| Methods  | 2   | 641.88  | 320.94  | 5.15   |
| Error    | 8   | 498.665 | 62.333  |         |
| **Total**  | 10  | 1140.545 |        |         |

## **b. Hypothesis Test for Significant Difference**  

- **Null Hypothesis**:  
  $$H_0: \mu_A = \mu_B = \mu_C$$  
- **Alternative Hypothesis**:  
  $$H_a: \text{At least one mean is different}$$  

- **Significance Levels**:  
  $$\alpha = 0.05$$  

We reject $H_0$ if: $$F > F_{0.05,2,8}$$  

From the ANOVA table:  
$$F = 5.15$$  

For $$\alpha = 0.05$$, the critical value:  
$$F_{0.05,2,8} = 4.46$$  
Since $5.15 > 4.46$, we **reject** $H_0$ at $\alpha = 0.05$.  

  

### **Conclusion:**  
At $\alpha = 0.05$, we conclude that at least one treatment method has a significantly different mean score
There is a significant difference in the mean student scores as evident from our hypothesis test result.
