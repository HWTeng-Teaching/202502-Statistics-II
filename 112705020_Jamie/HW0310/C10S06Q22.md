## a. p-value

### **1. Hypotheses**
- $H_0: \sigma_1^2 = \sigma_2^2$ (The variances are equal)
- $H_a: \sigma_1^2 \neq \sigma_2^2$ (The variances are different, two-tailed test)

### **2. Given Data**
#### Stock 1:
- Sample Mean: $\bar{x}_1 = 40.33$
- Sample Variance: $s_1^2 = 1.54$
- Sample Size: $n_1 = 15$

#### Stock 2:
- Sample Mean: $\bar{x}_2 = 42.54$
- Sample Variance: $s_2^2 = 2.96$
- Sample Size: $n_2 = 15$

### **3. Test Statistic**
Using the F-test:
$F = \frac{\text{Larger Variance}}{\text{Smaller Variance}} = \frac{s_2^2}{s_1^2} = \frac{2.96}{1.54}$

$F \approx 1.922$

### **4. Degrees of Freedom**
- Numerator: $df_1 = n_2 - 1 = 15 - 1 = 14$
- Denominator: $df_2 = n_1 - 1 = 15 - 1 = 14$

### **5. p-Value Approximation**
Using an F-distribution table or statistical software for $F = 1.922$ with $df_1 = 14$ and $df_2 = 14$:
$p \approx 0.23$

### **6. Conclusion**
- Since $p > 0.05$, we fail to reject $H_0$.
- There is **no significant difference** in the variances of the two stock prices.
- We can assume equal variances.

## **b. 99% Confidence Interval for the Ratio of Population Variances**
The confidence interval for the ratio of variances is given by:
$\left( \frac{s_2^2}{s_1^2} \times \frac{1}{F_{\alpha/2, df_1, df_2}}, \frac{s_2^2}{s_1^2} \times F_{\alpha/2, df_2, df_1} \right)$
For a 99% confidence level, using $F_{0.005, 14, 14} \approx 0.326$ and $F_{0.995, 14, 14} \approx 3.926$:

$\left( 1.922 \times \frac{1}{3.926}, 1.922 \times 3.065 \right)$

$(0.49, 5.89)$

### **Interpretation**
- We are **99% confident** that the true ratio of population variances lies between **0.49 and 5.89**.
- Since **1 is within the interval**, the data do not provide strong evidence that the variances are different.
