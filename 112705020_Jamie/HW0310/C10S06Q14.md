We test whether the older system has greater variability than the new system.

### **1. Hypotheses**
- $H_0: \sigma_1^2 = \sigma_2^2$
- $H_a: \sigma_1^2 < \sigma_2^2$ (one-tailed test)

### **2. Test Statistic**
Using the F-test:
$F = \frac{s_2^2}{s_1^2} = \frac{28.2^2}{15.6^2}$

$F = \frac{795.24}{243.36} = 3.27$

### **3. Critical Value and p-value**
Degrees of freedom:
- $df_1 = n_1 - 1 = 30 - 1 = 29$
- $df_2 = n_2 - 1 = 30 - 1 = 29$

Using an F-table for $\alpha = 0.05$, the critical value $F_{0.05,29,29}$ is approximately **1.86**.
And the p-value is less than 0.05.

Since $F = 3.27 > 1.86$, we reject $H_0$ and conclude that the older system has significantly higher variability.
