Since the same students were tested under both conditions, we use a paired t-test.

### 1. Hypothesis Test
Null Hypothesis: $H_0: \mu_d = 0$ 

Alternative Hypothesis: $H_a: \mu_d > 0$ 

### 2. Calculate Differences and Sample Statistics
Let $d = X_{\text{Imagery}} - X_{\text{No Imagery}}$.

we compute:

Mean difference: $\bar{d} = \frac{\sum d_i}{n} = 10$

Standard deviation of differences: $s_d = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (d_i - \bar{d})^2}{n - 1}} = 4.79$

Sample size: $n = 20$

### 3. Compute the t-statistic
The t-test statistic is:

$t = \frac{\bar{d}-0}{s_d / \sqrt{n}}$

$t = \frac{10 - 0}{4.79 / \sqrt{20}} = \frac{10}{1.071} = 9.34$

### 4. t-table (Critical Value)
Using $df = n - 1 = 19$ and a one-tailed test at $\alpha = 0.05$, find $t_{0.05,19}$ from the t-table.

$t_{0.025, 19} \approx \pm 2.093$

### 5. Decision Rule and Conclusion
- **Rejection Region:** if $|t| > 2.093$，then  Reject $H_0$  
- **Computed t-value:** $t = 9.34$  
- $9.34 > 2.093$，we reject $H_0$

### Conclusion
At the $\alpha = 0.05$ significance level, there is sufficient evidence to conclude that **using imagery significantly improves recall performance**.
