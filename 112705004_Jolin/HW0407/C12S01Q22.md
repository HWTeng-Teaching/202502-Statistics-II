## Solution
### a.

The line in the graph is upforward. So that, two variables are positive correlated.

### b.
If da Vinci is right, the correlation variable(the slope of the line) would be positive and approximate 1, and all the points would be almost on the line.

### c.
$\hat{y}_i = a + b x_i$

$n=8, \sum x_iy_i=221414,\bar{x}=166, \bar{y}=166.375,\sum x_i^2=221016$

$$
b=\frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}}=  \frac{\sum x_iy_i - n \bar{x} \bar{y}}{\sum x_i^2 - n \bar{x}^2} = \frac{221414 - 8* 166* 166.375}{221016 - 8* 166^2} = 0.8239
$$

$$
a = \bar{y} - b \bar{x} = 166.375 - 0.8239*166 = 29.6076
$$

The least-squares regression line: $\hat{y}_i = 29.6076 + 0.8239 x_i$

$b=0.8239$ is positive and approximate 1. The value *b* confirms my conclusions.

### d.
$$
\hat{y}_i = 29.6076 + 0.8239 x_i
$$

$x_i = 157$

$$
\hat{y}_i = 29.6076 + 0.8239*157 = 158.9599
$$

We would predict the person's height to be 158.9599.
