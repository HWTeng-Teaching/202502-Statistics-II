## Solution
### a.
$\hat{y}_i = a + b x_i$

From the table:

$$
a = 93.617, b = -1.251
$$

The least-squares regression line: $\hat{y}_i = 93.617 - 1.251 x_i$

### b.
$H_0: \beta=0, H_1:\beta \neq 0$

set $\alpha=0.05$

The test statistic and its sampling distribution:

$$
t_{\text{STAT}} = \frac{b}{\sqrt{MSE/S_{xx}}} \sim t_{(n-2)}
$$

From the table, the realized statistic:

$$
t^* = -10.471
$$

Set the reject region:
$t_{(n-2),\alpha/2}=t_{5,0.025}=2.571$
if $|t|>2.571$, we would reject $H_0$

Since $|t^*|=10.471>2.571$, we would reject $H_0$.

The data provide sufficient evidence to indicate that $x$ and $y$ are linearly related.

### c.
$\beta$'s 95% C.I.:

$$
\beta \in b \pm t_{n-2,\alpha/2} \sqrt\frac{MSE}{S_{xx}}
$$

$\sqrt\frac{MSE}{S_{xx}}=$standard error of x $=0.120$

$$
\beta \in -1.251 \pm 2.571 * 0.120
$$

$$
(-1.5595,-0.9425)
$$

### d.
$R^2=0.9564$, means there are about 95.64% of the variabilities in the percentage arrested can be explained by the linear relationship with group median age. 
Show the effective linear regression analysis.
