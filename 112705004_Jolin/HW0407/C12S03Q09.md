## Solution
### a.

The date trend goes upward. The two variables have positive correlation.

### b.
$\hat{y}_i = a + b x_i$

$n=16, \sum x_iy_i=132.8,\bar{x}=7.5, \bar{y}=1.04125,\sum x_i^2=1240$

$$
b=\frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}}=  \frac{\sum x_iy_i - n \bar{x} \bar{y}}{\sum x_i^2 - n \bar{x}^2} = \frac{132.8 - 16* 7.5* 1.04}{1240 - 16* 7.5^2} = 0.0231
$$

$$
a = \bar{y} - b \bar{x} = 1.04125 - 0.0231*7.5 = 0.868
$$

The least-squares regression line: $\hat{y}_i = 0.868 + 0.0231 x_i$

$H_0: \beta=0, H_1:\beta \neq 0$

set $\alpha=0.05$

The test statistic and its sampling distribution:

$$
t_{\text{STAT}} = \frac{b}{\sqrt{MSE/S_{xx}}} \sim t_{(n-2)}
$$

The realized statistic:

$$
MSE = S_{yy} - \frac{S_{xy}^2}{S_{xx}} =(\sum y_i^2 - n \bar{y}^2)- \frac{(\sum x_iy_i - n \bar{x} \bar{y})^2}{\sum x_i^2 - n \bar{x}^2} = 0.0004
$$

$$
S_{xx} =\sum x_i^2 - n \bar{x}^2 = 340
$$

$$
t^* = \frac{b}{\sqrt{MSE/S_{xx}}} =\frac{0.0231}{\sqrt{0.0004/340}} \approx 21.2971
$$

Set the reject region:
$t_{(n-2),\alpha/2}=t_{14,0.025}=2.145$
if $|t|>2.145$, we would reject $H_0$

Since $t^*=21.2971>2.145$, we would reject $H_0$.

The data significantly indicate that there is a linear relationship between the number of miles of roadways and the year.

| Source     |  df | SS     | MS     | F      |

| Regression |  1  | $\frac{S_{xy}^2}{S_{xx}}$| $SSR/1$| $MSR/MSE$|

| Total      |  n-1  | ${S_{yy}}$ |        |        |

$n=16, \sum x_iy_i=132.8,\bar{x}=7.5, \bar{y}=1.04125,\sum x_i^2=1240,\sum y_i^2=17.5336$

$TSS = \sum y_i^2 - n\bar{y}^2 =17.5336-16*1.04125^2=0.186375$

$SSR = \frac{S_{xy}^2}{S_{xx}} = \frac{(\sum x_iy_i - n \bar{x} \bar{y})^2}{\sum x_i^2 - n \bar{x}^2} =\frac{(132.8 - 16* 7.5* 1.04125)^2}{1240 - 16* 7.5^2} =0.181243$

$SSE=TSS-SSR = 0.186375-0.181243=0.005132$

$MSR=SSR/1=0.181243$

$MSE=SSE/(n-2)=0.005132/(16-2)=0.000367$

$F=MSR/MSE=43146.93/620.09=69.5817$

| Source     |  df | SS     | MS     | F      |

$H_0:$ The model is not useful in predicting $y$, $H_1:$The model is useful in predicting $y$.

set $\alpha=0.05$

The test statistic and its sampling distribution:

$$
F_{\text{STAT}} = \frac{MSR}{MSE} \sim F_{1,(n-2)}
$$

From the ANOVA table, we know the realized statistic:

$$
F^* = 494.389
$$

Set the reject region:
$F_{1,(n-2),\alpha}=F_{1,14,0.05}=4.60$
if $F>4.60$, we would reject $H_0$

Since $F^*=494.389>4.60$, we would reject $H_0$.

The data significantly indicate that there is a linear relationship between the number of miles of roadways and the year.

$t^2 = 21.2971^2 = 453.566$, $t$ is close to $F$. Although there have some calculating errors cause the difference between two values. We still could say that $t^2=F$ is verified.

### d.

$$
r^2=\frac{S^2_{xy}/S_{xx}}{S_{yy}}=\frac{\frac{(132.8 - 16* 7.5* 1.04125)^2}{1240 - 16* 7.5^2}}{17.5336-16*1.04125^2}=0.9735
$$

$r^2 = 0.9735$ means there are about 97.35% of the variabilities in the number of urban roadway miles can be explained by the linear relationship with year.
