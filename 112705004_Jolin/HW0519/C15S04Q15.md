## Solution
### a.
Three common procedures are paired t-test, sign test, and Wilcoxon signed-rank test.
Paired t-test is parametric.
The required assumptions for the parametric procedure are the paired data, independent paired differences, and normal distribution.
These data have skewness or nonsymmetric distribution. The data violated normal distribution, so sign test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test is more appropriate.
