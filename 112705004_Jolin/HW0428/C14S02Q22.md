## Solution

$H_0: p_1 = p_2 = ... = p_7 = 1/7, H_a:$ at least a $p_i$ is different from $1/7$

set $\alpha=0.05$

The test statistic and its sampling distribution:

$$
x^2 = \sum \frac{(O_i-E_i)^2}{E_i} \sim x^2_{k-1}
$$

The realized statistic:

$E_i = np_i = (24+36+27+26+32+26+29)*(1/7) = 28.571$

$$
{x^2}^* = \sum \frac{(O_i-E_i)^2}{E_i} = \sum \frac{{O_i}^2}{E_i} - n = 3.633
$$

Set the reject region:

$x^2_{\alpha,(k-1)} = x^2_{0.05,6} =12.5916$

if ${x^2}>12.5916$, we would reject $H_0$

Since ${x^2} = 3.633 < 12.5916$, we would not reject $H_0$.

There is no sufficient evidence to indicate that there is a difference in the incidence of heart attacks depending on the day of the week.
