## Solution
### a.
$n_1 = 14,$ $n_2 = 8,$ $n_3 = 4,$ $n_4 = 11,$ $n = 37$

Plot the ANOVA table:
| Source | df | SS |MS|F|
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Treatment|k-1|SST|SST/(k-1) | MST/MSE|
| Error|n-k|SSE|SSE/(n-k) | |
| Total|n-1|TSS| | |

$G = \sum_{ij}x_{ij} = 40.31,$ $CM = \frac{G^2}{n} = \frac{40.31^2}{37} \approx 43.916$
  
$TSS = \sum_{ij} x_{ij}^2 - CM = 51.6489 - 43.916 = 7.7329$

$T_1 = 12.55,$ $T_2 = 10.24,$ $T_3 = 4.9,$ $T_4 = 12.62$

$SST = \sum \frac{T_i^2}{n_i} -CM = (\frac{12.55^2}{14} + \frac{10.24^2}{8} + \frac{4.9^2}{11} + \frac{12.62^2}{11}) - 43.916 \approx 44.838 - 43.916 = 0.9225$

$SSE = TSS - SST = 7.7329 - 0.9225 = 6.8104$
  
$MST = \frac{SST}{k-1} = \frac{641.88}{4-1} = 0.3075$

$MSE = \frac{SSE}{n-k} = \frac{498.67}{37-4} = 0.2064$

$F = \frac{MST}{MSE} = \frac{0.3075}{0.2064} =1.4898$

| Source | df | SS |MS|F|
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Treatment|3| 0.9225| 0.3075|1.4898 |
| Error|33| 6.8104| 0.2064| |
| Total|36| 7.7329| | |

### b.

$H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2 = \mu_3 =\mu_4, H_a:$ at least one mean is different

(1) set $\alpha = 0.05$

Test statistic and its sampling distribution:

$$
F_{\text{STAT}} = \frac{MST}{MSE} \sim F_{(k-1),(n-k),\alpha}
$$

From the ANOVA table: $F^* = 1.4898$

Find the reject region:

$$
F_{(k-1),(n-k),\alpha} = F_{3,33,0.05}  \approx 2.92
$$

if $F > 2.92$, reject $H_0$

Since $F^* = 1.4898 < 2.92$, we would not reject $H_0$

There isn't sufficient evidence of a significant difference in average price for these packages.

(2) set $\alpha = 0.01$

Test statistic and its sampling distribution:

$$
F_{\text{STAT}} = \frac{MST}{MSE} \sim F_{(k-1),(n-k)}
$$

From the ANOVA table: $F^* = 1.4898$

Find the reject region:

$$
F_{(k-1),(n-k)} = F_{3,33}  \approx 4.51
$$

if $F > 4.51$, reject $H_0$

Since $F^* = 1.4898 < 4.51$, we would not reject $H_0$

There isn't sufficient evidence of a significant difference in average price for these packages.

### c.
$\bar{x}_1 = 0.896,$ $\bar{x}_4 = 1.147$

set $\alpha = 0.05$

$t_{n-k,\alpha/2} = t_{33,0.025} = 2.035$

The 95% C.I. is:

$$
\mu_1 - \mu_4 \in (\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_4) \pm t\_{n-k,\alpha/2} * \sqrt{MSE*(\frac{1}{n_A} + \frac{1}{n_B})}
$$

$$
\mu_1 - \mu_4 \in (0.896 - 1.147) \pm 2.035 * \sqrt{0.2064*(\frac{1}{14} + \frac{1}{11})}
$$

$$
\mu_1 - \mu_4 \in (-0.624, 0.122)
$$

Because 0 is in the C.I., we could say that there is no sufficient evidence that there is significant difference in price between light tuna in water and light tuna in oil.

### d.

$\bar{x}_2 = 0.896,$ $\bar{x}_3 = 1.147$

set $\alpha = 0.05$

$t\_{n-k,\alpha/2} = t_{33,0.025} = 2.035$

The 95% C.I. is:

$$
\mu_2 - \mu_3 \in (\bar{x}_2 - \bar{x}_3) \pm t\_{n-k,\alpha/2} * \sqrt{MSE*(\frac{1}{n_A} + \frac{1}{n_B})}
$$

$$
\mu_2 - \mu_3 \in (1.28 - 1.225) \pm 2.035 * \sqrt{0.2064*(\frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{4})}
$$

$$
\mu_2 - \mu_3 \in (-0.511, 0.621)
$$

Because 0 is in the C.I., we could say that there is no sufficient evidence that there is significant difference in price between white tuna in water and white tuna in oil.

### e.
The researcher might be interest of other pair comparisons below:
Light tuna in water and white tuna in water.
Light tuna in oil and white tuna in oil.
Light tuna in water and white tuna in oil.
Light tuna in oil and white tuna in water.
