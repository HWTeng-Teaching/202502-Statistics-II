## Solution
$\omega = q_{\alpha}(k,df) * \sqrt{\frac{MSE}{n_t}}$

$q_{\alpha}(k,df) = q_{0.01}(4,16) = 5.19$

$\omega = 5.19 * \sqrt{\frac{41.25}{5}} = 14.91$

| $\bar{x}_2$ | $\bar{x}_3$ | $\bar{x}_1$ |$\bar{x}_4$|
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 234.8|251.6|262.2|268.6|

Comparing all the difference of means by $\omega$, we could know that $\bar{x}_3$ and $\bar{x}_1$, $\bar{x}_1$  and $\bar{x}_4$ don't have significant difference.

That means $\mu_2$ has significant difference. from all the other, $\mu_3$ and $\mu_4$ have significant difference.
