## Solution
### a.
Block: items
Treatments: stores

### b.

$H_0: \mu_V = \mu_R = \mu_S = \mu_W, H_a:$ at least one mean is different

set $\alpha = 0.05$

Test statistic and its sampling distribution:

$$
F_{\text{STAT}} = \frac{MST}{MSE} \sim F_{(k-1),(k-1)(b-1)}
$$

From the ANOVA table: $F^* = 26.52$

Find the reject region:

$$
F_{(k-1),(k-1)(b-1)} = F_{3,21} = 3.07
$$

if $F > 3.07$, reject $H_0$

Since $F^* = 26.52 > 3.07$, we would reject $H_0$

The data provide sufficient evidence to indicate that there are significant differences in prices from store to store.

### c.
$H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2 = ... = \mu_8, H_a:$ at least one mean is different

set $\alpha = 0.05$

Test statistic and its sampling distribution:

$$
F_{\text{STAT}} = \frac{MSB}{MSE} \sim F_{(b-1),(k-1)(b-1)}
$$

From the ANOVA table: $F^* = 35.32$

Find the reject region:

$$
F_{(b-1),(k-1)(b-1)} = F_{7,21} = 2.49
$$

if $F > 2.49$, reject $H_0$

Since $F^* = 35.32 > 2.49$, we would reject $H_0$

There are significant difference from block to block, which means blocking was effective.

## Solution
### a.

$q_{\alpha}(k,df) = q_{0.05}(4,21) \approx 3.96$

### b.

$\omega = q_{\alpha}(k,df) * \sqrt{\frac{MSE}{n_t}}$

$\omega = 3.96 * \sqrt{\frac{0.1658}{8}} = 0.5701$

### c.

| $\bar{x}_W$ | $\bar{x}_S$ | $\bar{x}_V$ | $\bar{x}_R$ |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
|2.68125|3.75250|4.13500|4.34000|

Comparing all the difference of means by $\omega$, we could know that $\bar{x}_S$, $\bar{x}_V$ and $\bar{x}_R$ don't have significant difference.

That means $\mu_W$ has significant difference from each other.
