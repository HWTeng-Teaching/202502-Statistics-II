## Solution
### a.
Variables of **pretreatment**: $n = 21, \bar{x} = 20.3, s = 5.0$
1. $H_0: \mu = 25, H_1: \mu < 25$
2. set $\alpha = 0.05$
3. $t_{STAT} = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{s/\sqrt{n}} \sim t_{n-1}$
4. $t^* = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{s/\sqrt{n}}$

    $t^* = \frac{20.3 - 25}{5.0/\sqrt{21}} = -4.308$
5. when $df = n-1 =20, t_{0.05}=1.725$

    reject region: if $t < -1.725$, reject $H_0$

6. $-4.308 < -1.725$, we would reject $H_0$

There is sufficient evidence that the true pretreatment mean is less than 25.

### b.
Variables of **posttreatment**: $n = 21, \bar{x} = 26.6, s = 7.4$

To construct a 95% confidence interval:

$$
\mu \in \bar{x} \pm t_{\alpha/2, n-1} \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}, \alpha = 0.05
$$

$t_{0.025,20} = 2.086, \sigma \approx s$

$$\mu \in26.6 \pm 2.086 \frac{7.4}{\sqrt{21}}$$

The confidence interval is:
$$(23.232, 29.969)$$

### c.
$\bar{x}_{pre}=20.3, \bar{x}_{post} = 26.6,\bar{x}_{follow} =  27.7$

From the hypothesis test in a, we could know that $\mu_{pre}$ is less than 25.

In b, the 95% confidence interval for $\mu_{post}$ is (23.232, 29.969). Since $\bar{x}_{pre} = 20.3$ is outside this interval, we have strong evidence to suggest that $\mu_{post}$ is larger than $\mu_{pre}$, which indicates a significant effect of the treatment.

Since $\bar{x}_{follow} = 27.7$ is very close to $\bar{x}_{post} = 26.6$, it suggests that the treatment effect likely persists over time.
