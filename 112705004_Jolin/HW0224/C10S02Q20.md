## Solution
$n = 25, \bar{x}=69.7, s = 16$

1. $H_0: \mu = 74, H_1: \mu\neq74$

2. set $\alpha = .05$

3. $t_{STAT} = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{s/\sqrt{n}} \sim t_{n-1}$

4. $t^* = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{s/\sqrt{n}}$

    $t^* = \frac{69.7 - 74}{16/\sqrt{25}} = -1.344$

5. when $df = n-1=24, t_{0.025} = 2.064$
    
    reject region: if t > 2.064 or t < -2.064, reject
    
6. $-1.344 > -2.064$, We won't reject $H_0$

There is no evidence that the average CBF for stroke patients is different from that healthy people.($\mu<74$)
