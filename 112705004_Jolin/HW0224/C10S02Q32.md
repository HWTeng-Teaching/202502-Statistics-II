## Solution
### a.
$H_0: \mu=1, H_1: \mu \neq 1$

set $\alpha = 0.05$

**By T-value analysis:**

$t_{STAT} \sim t_{n-1}$

$T-value = 1.64$

when $df = n-1=26, t_{0.025}=2.056$

reject region: if $t>2.056$ or $t<-2.056$, reject $H_0$

$1.64<2.056$, we would not reject $H_0$

There is no significant evidence that the mean weight of packages of ground beef is different from 1.

**P-value analysis:**

if $P-value < \alpha$, we reject $H_0$

$P-value = 0.113$

$0.113>0.05$, we would not reject $H_0$

There is no significant evidence that the mean weight of packages of ground beef is different from 1.

**By estimation procedures:**

Construct 95% CI for $\mu$, if $\bar{x}$ is in CI, we would not reject $H_0$

$\mu \in (0.9867, 1.1178)$

Because $\bar{x}=1.0522$ is in the confidence interval, we would not reject $H_0$

There is no significant evidence that the mean weight of packages of ground beef is different from 1.

### b.
According to data:

$n=27, \bar{x}=1.0522, s=0.1657,\mu_=1$

**Calculate T-value:**

$t^* = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{s/\sqrt{n}}$

$t^* = \frac{1.0522 - 1}{0.1657/\sqrt{27}} = 1.637 \approx 1.64$

T-value is approximately the same with MINITAB.

**Construct the CI:**

$\mu \in \bar{x} \pm t_{\alpha/2, n-1} \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}, \alpha = 0.05$

$t_{0.025,26} = 2.056, \sigma \approx s$

$\mu \in 1.0522 \pm 2.056 \frac{0.1657}{\sqrt{27}}$

$\mu \in (0.9867, 1.1178)$

CI is approximately the same with MINITAB.

So that, T-value = 1.64,upper confident limit =1.1178,lower confident limit = 0.9867.
