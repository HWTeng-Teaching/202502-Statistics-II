## Solution
### a.
This is  a repeated measures design.
Each subject provides multiple responses, one for each treatment (antibiotic).

### b.
The normal probability plot (Q-Q plot) of the residuals appears fairly linear, especially through the middle range of the data.
The residuals for each antibiotic appear to be randomly distributed horizontally, with no obvious funnel shape or systematic pattern.
Each children is tested independently.
The unusual analysis of variance assumptions appear to be satisfied, since three assumptions are satisfied.

### c.
