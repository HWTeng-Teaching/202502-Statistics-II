There is an upward line with high variability.

### b.

By the table above:

The least-squares regression line: $\hat{y}_i = 80.9 + 270.8 x_i$

The least-squares regression line is the same as the scatter plot shows.

### c.

$H_0: \beta=0, H_1:\beta \neq 0$

set $\alpha=0.05$

The test statistic and its sampling distribution:

$$
t_{\text{STAT}} = \frac{b}{\sqrt{MSE/S_{xx}}} \sim t_{(n-2)}
$$

The realized statistic:

$$
t^* = 3.96
$$

Set the reject region:

$t_{(n-2),\alpha/2}=t_{10,0.025}=2.228$

if $|t|>2.228$, we would reject $H_0$

Since $t^*=3.96>2.228$, we would not reject $H_0$.

The data present sufficient evidence to indicate that the amount of phosphorus applied to the soil.

### d.
By the table above:

The $90 \% C.I. = (112.130, 157.900)$
