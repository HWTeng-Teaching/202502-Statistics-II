## Solution
### a.
$\bar{x} = 98.358, \bar{y} = 74.667,\sum x_iy_i = 88140.6, \sum x_i^2 = 116103.03, \sum y_i^2 = 67312$

$S_{xy} = \sum x_iy_i -n \bar{x} \bar{y} = 88140.6 - 12 * 98.358 * 74.667 = 11.4386$

$S_{xx} = \sum x_i^2 -n \bar{x}^2 = 116103.03 - 12 * 98.358^2 = 11.4760$

$S_{yy} = \sum y_i^2 -n \bar{y}^2 = 67312 - 12 * 74.667^2 = 410.0693$

$$
r =\frac{S_{xy}}{\sqrt{S_{xx} S_{yy}}} = \frac{11.4386}{\sqrt{11.4760 * 410.0693}} \approx 0.1667
$$

### b.

$H_0: \rho=0, H_1:\rho \neq 0$

set $\alpha=0.05$

The test statistic and its sampling distribution:

$$
T = r \sqrt{\frac{n-2}{1-r^2}} \sim t_{n-2}
$$

The realized statistic:

$$
t^* = 0.1667 \sqrt{\frac{12-2}{1-0.1667^2}} =0.5346
$$

Set the reject region:

$t_{(n-2),\alpha/2}=t_{10,0.025}=2.228$

if $|t|>2.228$, we would reject $H_0$

Since $t^*= 0.5346 < 2.228$, we would reject $H_0$.

There is no sufficient evidence to indicate that there is a correlation between these two variables.
