## Solution

$\bar{x} = 894.44, \bar{y} = 233.33,\sum x_iy_i = 1901500, \sum x_i^2 = 7802500, \sum y_i^2 = 498200$

$S_{xy} = \sum x_iy_i -n \bar{x} \bar{y} = 1901500 - 9 * 894.44 * 233.33 = 23202.8332$

$S_{xx} = \sum x_i^2 -n \bar{x}^2 = 7802500 - 9 * 894.44^2 = 602293.7776$

$S_{yy} = \sum y_i^2 -n \bar{y}^2 = 498200 - 9 * 233.33^2 = 8213.9999$

$$
r =\frac{S_{xy}}{\sqrt{S_{xx} S_{yy}}} = \frac{23202.8332}{\sqrt{602293.7776 * 8213.9999}} \approx 0.33
$$

$H_0: \rho=0, H_1:\rho > 0$

set $\alpha=0.05$

The test statistic and its sampling distribution:

$$
T = r \sqrt{\frac{n-2}{1-r^2}} \sim t_{n-2}
$$

The realized statistic:

$$
t^* = 0.33 \sqrt{\frac{9-2}{1-0.33^2}} =0.92
$$

Set the reject region:

$t_{(n-2),\alpha}=t_{7,0.05}=1.895$

if $t>1.895$, we would reject $H_0$

Since $t^*= 0.92 < 1.895$, we would not reject $H_0$.

There is not a significant positive correlation between average maximum drill hole depth and average maximum temperature.
