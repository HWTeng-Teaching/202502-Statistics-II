## Solution
### a.
We should use correlation analysis, because we donâ€™t have a clear dependent/independent variable.

### b.
$\bar{x} = 355.71, \bar{y} = 22.14,\sum x_iy_i = 56140, \sum x_i^2 = 896700, \sum y_i^2 = 3541$

$S_{xy} = \sum x_iy_i -n \bar{x} \bar{y} = 56140 - 7 * 355.71 * 22.14 = 1012.06$

$S_{xx} = \sum x_i^2 -n \bar{x}^2 = 896700 - 7 * 22.14^2 = 10992.77$

$S_{yy} = \sum y_i^2 -n \bar{y}^2 = 3541 - 7 * 22.14^2 = 109.74$

$$
r =\frac{S_{xy}}{\sqrt{S_{xx} S_{yy}}} = \frac{1012.06}{\sqrt{10992.77 * 109.74}} \approx 0.92
$$

$H_0: \rho=0, H_1:\rho \neq 0$

set $\alpha=0.05$

The test statistic and its sampling distribution:

$$
T = r \sqrt{\frac{n-2}{1-r^2}} \sim t_{n-2}
$$

The realized statistic:

$$
t^* = 0.92 \sqrt{\frac{7-2}{1-0.92^2}} =5.249
$$

Set the reject region:

$t_{(n-2),\alpha/2}=t_{5,0.025}=2.571$

if $|t|>2.571$, we would reject $H_0$

Since $t^*= 5.249 > 2.571$, we would reject $H_0$.
