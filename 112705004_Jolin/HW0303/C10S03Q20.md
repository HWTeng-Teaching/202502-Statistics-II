## Solution
Above Town's sample mean $\bar{X}_A = \frac{4.8+5.2+5.0+4.9+5.1}{5} = 5.0$
Below Town's sample mean $\bar{X}_B = \frac{5.0+4.7+4.9+4.8+4.9}{5} = 4.86$
Above Town's sample variance ${S_A}^2=0.025$
Below Town's sample variance ${S_B}^2=0.013$

### a.
$H_0: \mu_A-\mu_B = 0, H_1:\mu_A - \mu_B >0$
set $\alpha = 0.05$

Test if variance are the same:

$if \frac{larger S^2}{smaller S^2} \leq 3$, the equal variance assumption is reasonable

$\frac{0.025}{0.013} = 1.923 \leq 3$, so that ${\sigma_A}^2 = {\sigma_B}^2$

**Pool Estimator:**

$S^2 = \frac{(n_A-1){S_A}^2+(n_B-1){S_B}^2}{n_1+n_2-2} =\frac{(5-1)0.025+(5-1)0.013}{5+5-2}=0.019$

Test statistic and its sampling distribution:

$$
t_{\text{STAT}} = \frac{(\bar{X}_A - \bar{X}_B) -0}{\sqrt{S^2 * (\frac{1}{n_A} + \frac{1}{n_B}})} \sim t\_{n_A+n_B-2}
$$

Realized test statistic:

$$
t^* = \frac{(5.0-4.86)-0}{\sqrt{0.019(\frac{1}{5}+\frac{1}{5})}} = 1.606
$$

Find the reject region:

$$t_{{n_A+n_B-2},\alpha}=t_{8,0.05}=\pm 1.860$$

Reject region:
if $t>1.860$, reject $H_0$

$t^*=1.606 < 1.860$, so we won't reject $H_0$

There is no sufficient evidence to indicate that the mean oxygen content below the town is less than the mean oxygen content above.

### b.
The 95% confidence interval of $\mu_A -\mu_B$ :

$$(\bar{X}_A-\bar{X}_B ) \pm t_{{n_A+n_B-2},\alpha/2}\sqrt{(\frac{1}{n_A}+\frac{1}{n_B})S^2}$$

$$
(5.0-4.86)\pm t_{8,0.025}\sqrt{(\frac{1}{5}+\frac{1}{5})0.019^2}=(5.0-4.6)\pm 2.306\sqrt{(\frac{1}{5}+\frac{1}{5})0.019}
$$

The confidence interval is:

$$
(-0.061,0.341)
$$

Because the interval includes 0, there is no sufficient evidence that there has the difference in the mean.
