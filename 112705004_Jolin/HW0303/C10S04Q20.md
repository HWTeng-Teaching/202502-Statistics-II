## Solution
**Define:**
a: with imagery
b: without imagery

$d_i = a_i - b_i$

$\bar{d} = \frac{15+15+15+9+16+8+12+8+10+12+9+4+10+4+17+13+4+7+7+10}{20} = 10.25$

$S_d=4.051$

$H_0: \mu_a-\mu_b = 0, H_1: \mu_a-\mu_b >0$

set $\alpha = 0.05$

Test statistic and its sampling distribution:

$$
t_{STAT} = \frac{\bar{d} - 0}{S_d/\sqrt{n}} \sim t_{n-1}
$$

Realized test statistic:

$$
t^* = \frac{10.25 - 0}{4.051/\sqrt{20}} = 11.316
$$

Find the reject region:

$$
t_{n-1,\alpha} = t_{19,0.05} = \pm 1.729
$$

reject region:
if $t > 1.729$, reject $H_0$

$t^*=11.316 > 1.729$, we would reject $H_0$

There is sufficient evidence that the average recall score is higher when imagery is used.
