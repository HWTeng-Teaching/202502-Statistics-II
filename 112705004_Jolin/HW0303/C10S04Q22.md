## Solution

$D_i = A_i - B_i$

$\bar{D} = \frac{0.006+(-0.018)+(-0.014)+(-0.011)+(-0.004)+(-0.019)}{6} = -0.01$

$S_D=0.0095$
### a.
$H_0: \mu_A-\mu_B = 0, H_1: \mu_A-\mu_B \neq 0$

set $\alpha = 0.05$

Test statistic and its sampling distribution:

$$
t_{STAT} = \frac{\bar{d} - 0}{S_d/\sqrt{n}} \sim t_{n-1}
$$

Realized test statistic:

$$
t^* = \frac{-0.01 - 0}{0.0095/\sqrt{6}} = -2.578
$$

Find the reject region:

$$
t_{n-1,\alpha/2} = t_{5,0.025} = \pm 2.571
$$

reject region:
if $|t| > 2.571$, reject $H_0$

$|t^*|=2.578 > 2.571$, we would reject $H_0$

There is sufficient evidence to indicate a difference between the average densities of cakes prepared using the two types of batter.

### b.
The 95% confidence interval of $\mu_A -\mu_B$ :

$$
\bar{D} \pm t_{n-1,\alpha/2}\frac{S_D}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

$$
-0.01\pm t_{5,0.025}\frac{0.0095}{\sqrt{6}}=-0.01\pm 2.571\frac{0.0095}{\sqrt{6}}
$$

The confidence interval is:

$$
(-0.01997,-0.00003)
$$

Because 0 is not in the confidence interval, there is sufficient evidence to indicate a difference between the average densities of cakes prepared using the two types of batter.
