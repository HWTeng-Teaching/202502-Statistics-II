## Solution
$n_1 = n_2 = 30$
 
Standard deriviation of Old System is larger.

$H_0: \frac{{\sigma_2}^2}{{\sigma_1}^2} = 1, H_1:  \frac{{\sigma_2}^2}{{\sigma_1}^2} < 1$

set $\alpha = 0.05$

Test statistic and its sampling distribution:

$$
F_{STAT} = \frac{S_2^2}{S_1^2} \sim F_{n_2-1, n_1-1}
$$

$$
F^* = \frac{{S_2}^2}{{S_1}^2} = \frac{28.2^2}{15.6^2} = 3.268
$$

Find the p-vlaue:

$$
p  = P ( F_{n_2-1, n_1-1} > F^* ) = P ( F_{29,29} > 3.268)
$$

$$
p-value < 0.005
$$

Since p-value < 0.05, we would reject $H_0$

Which means the variance of old system is larger than new system.

There is sufficient evidence that the variability in daily production warrants increased maintenance of the older fabricating system.
