## Solution
### a.
$n_1 = n_2 = 15$
 
$S_2^2$ is larger.

$H_0: \frac{{\sigma_2}^2}{{\sigma_1}^2} = 1, H_1:  \frac{{\sigma_2}^2}{{\sigma_1}^2} < 1$

set $\alpha = 0.05$

Test statistic and its sampling distribution:

$$
F_{STAT} = \frac{{S_2}^2}{{S_1}^2} \sim F_{n_2-1, n_1-1}
$$

$$
F^* = \frac{{S_2}^2}{{S_1}^2} = \frac{2.96}{1.54} = 1.922
$$

Find the p-vlaue:

$$
p =2 * P(F_{n_2-1, n_1-1}>F^*) = 2 * P(F_{14,14}> 1.922)
$$

$$
p-value > 0.2
$$

Since $p-value > 0.05$, we would reject $H_0$

Which means ${\sigma_2}^2$ is not different from ${\sigma_1}^2$.

There is no sufficient evidence to indicate a difference between the variabilities of the closing prices of the two stocks for the populations associatiated with two samples.
### b.
set $\alpha = 0.01$,

$F_{n_2-1,n_1-1,\alpha/2} = F_{14,14,0.005}= 4.25$,
$F_{n_1-1,n_2-1,\alpha/2} = F_{14,14,0.005}= 4.25$

The 99% confidence interval is:

$$
\frac{S_2^2}{S_1^2} \frac{1}{F_{n_2-1,n_1-1}} < \frac{{\sigma_2}^2}{{\sigma_1}^2} < \frac{S_2^2}{S_1^2} F_{n_1-1,n_2-1}
$$

$$
\frac{2.96}{1.54} \frac{1}{4.25} < \frac{{\sigma_2}^2}{{\sigma_1}^2} < \frac{2.96}{1.54} 4.25
$$

$$
(0.452,8.169)
$$

1 is include in the 99% confidence interval, so we would not reject $H_0$.

There is no sufficient evidence to indicate a difference between the variabilities of the closing prices of the two stocks for the populations associatiated with two samples.
