## Solution
number of completions: $n_C$
number of the number of yards per pass: $n_Y$
### a.
Mean of completions: $\bar{X}_C = \frac{\Sigma{x_i}}{n_C} = 22.5$

Mean of the number of yards per pass: $\bar{X}_Y= \frac{\Sigma{x_i}}{n} =12.95$

Standard deviation of completions: $S_C = \sqrt{\frac{\Sigma{(x_i - \bar{X}_C)^2}}{n_C-1}} = 4.705$

Standard deviation of the number of yards per pass: $S_Y = \sqrt{\frac{\Sigma{(x_i - \bar{X}_Y)^2}}{n_Y-1}}= 2.456$

### b.
set $\alpha = 0.05$,

$x^2_{n-1,\alpha/2} = x^2_{16,0.025}=28.8485$,
$x^2_{n-1,1-\alpha/2} = x^2_{16,0.975}=6.90766$

The 95% confidence interval is:

$$
\sigma^2 \in [\frac{(n-1)*{S_C}^2}{x^2_{n-1,\alpha/2}},\frac{(n-1)*{S_C}^2}{x^2_{n-1,1-\alpha/2}}]
$$

$$
\sigma^2 \in [\frac{(17-1)*4.705^2}{28.8485},\frac{(17-1)*4.705^2}{6.90766}]
$$

$$
\sigma^2 \in (12.278,51.275)
$$


I would prefer a small variability in the number of completed passes because it means the player is more consistent that the number of completed passes doesnâ€™t fluctuate dramatically.

### c.
set $\alpha = 0.05$,

$x^2_{n-1,\alpha/2} = x^2_{16,0.025}=28.8485$,
$x^2_{n-1,1-\alpha/2} = x^2_{16,0.975}=6.90766$

The 95% confidence interval is:

$$
\sigma^2 \in [\frac{(n-1)*{S_Y}^2}{x^2_{n-1,\alpha/2}},\frac{(n-1)*{S_Y}^2}{x^2_{n-1,1-\alpha/2}}]
$$

$$
\sigma^2 \in [\frac{(17-1)*{2.456}^2}{28.8485},\frac{(17-1)*{2.456}^2}{6.90766}]
$$

$$
\sigma^2 \in (3.345,13.972)
$$

$\sigma$ has 95% confidence that fall in $(1.829, 3.738)$

### d.
$H_0: \sigma = 4,H_1: \sigma \neq 4$

set $\alpha = 0.05$

Test statistic and its sampling distribution:

$$
x_{STAT}^2 = \frac{(n-1)*S_Y^2}{\sigma_0^2} \sim x_{n-1}^2
$$

$$
x^{2*} = \frac{(n-1)*S_Y^2}{\sigma_0^2} = \frac{(17-1)*2.456^2}{4^2} = 6.032
$$

Find the reject region:

$x_{n-1,\alpha/2}^2 =x_{16,0.025}^2=28.8485$

if $x^2>28.8485$, reject $H_0$

Since $x^2=6.032 <28.8485$, we won't reject $H_0$.

There isn't sufficient evidence that the standard deviation of the yards per pass for this quarterback differs from $\sigma = 4$
