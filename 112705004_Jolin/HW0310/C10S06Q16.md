## Solution
Standard deriviation of Chemistry is larger.

$H_0: \frac{{\sigma_C}^2}{{\sigma_P}^2} = 1, H_1:  \frac{{\sigma_C}^2}{{\sigma_P}^2} \neq 1$

set $\alpha = 0.05$

Test statistic and its sampling distribution:

$$
F_{STAT} = \frac{{S_C}^2}{{S_P}^2} \sim F_{n_C-1, n_P-1}
$$

$$
F^* = \frac{{S_C}^2}{{S_P}^2} = \frac{114^2}{103^2} = 1.225
$$

Find the reject region:

$$
F_{n_C-1, n_P-1,\alpha/2} = F_{14, 14,0.025} = 2.95
$$

if $F>2.95$, reject $H_0$

Since $1.225<2.95$, we won't reject $H_0$

There is no sufficient evidence that the two population variances are not equal. 

Find the p-vlaue:

$$
p = 2 * P(F_{n_2-1, n_1-1}>F^*) = 2 * P(F_{14,14}>1.225)
$$

$$
p-value > 0.2
$$

Since $p-value > 0.05$, we won't reject $H_0$

There is no sufficient evidence that the two population variances are not equal.
