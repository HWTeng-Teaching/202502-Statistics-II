## Solution
### a.
A randomized block design was used: five children served as blocks, and four antibiotics as treatments. This design controls for individual differences among children and isolates the effect of the antibiotics.

### b.
ANOVA assumptions:

Residuals are approximately normally distributed.

Homogeneity of variances across treatment/block combinations.

The normal probability plot shows residuals lie close to the reference line with no outliers, supporting normality.
However, the residuals vs. antibiotic plot suggests differing variances, especially between Antibiotic 1 and 2, indicating a possible violation of the homogeneity assumption.

Conclusion: Normality is satisfied; equal variances are questionable.

### c.
| Child | Rank 1 | Rank 2 | Rank 3 | Rank 4 |
| ----- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| 1     | 3      | 4      | 1      | 2      |
| 2     | 3      | 2      | 4      | 1      |
| 3     | 2      | 4      | 3      | 1      |
| 4     | 3      | 1      | 4      | 2      |
| 5     | 3      | 1      | 4      | 2      |

$T_1 = 14 \quad \quad T_2 = 12 \quad \quad T_3 = 16 \quad \quad T_4 = 8$  

$b = 5 \quad \quad k=4$
  
$H_0$: 4 distributions are identical 

$H_a$: at least one distribution is different

$\alpha = 0.05$

Test statistic:

$$
F_{r,STAT} = \frac{12}{bk(k+1)} \sum T_i^2 - 3b(k+1) \sim \chi^2_{(k-1)}
$$

Realized statistic:

$$
F_r^* = \frac{12}{5\*4\*5} (14^2 + 12^2 + 16^2 + 8^2) - 3\*5\*5 = 4.2
$$

Rejection region: $\\{F_r: F_r > \chi^2_{3;0.05} \approx 7.815 \\}$

Since $F_r = 4.2 < 7.815$, we fail to reject $H_0$.
There is no significant difference in the children's taste responses to the four antibiotics.
