## Question
The **rule of thumb** states that if the ratio of the larger sample variance to the smaller sample variance is **less than 4**, the variances can be considered approximately equal.

Given:

$\quad n_1 = 4, \quad n_2 = 3$

The test statistic follows an $F$ distribution:

$F = \frac{S_1^2}{S_2^2} \sim F_{(n_1-1),(n_2-1)} = F_{(3,2)}$

Using an $F$-table, we find:

$P(F_{(3,2)} > 3) \approx 0.265$

Since this is a two-tailed test, the approximate significance level is:

$\alpha \approx 2 \times 0.265 = 0.530$
