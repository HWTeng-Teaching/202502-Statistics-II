## Solution
$s_1 = 114 \quad s_1^2 = 12996 \quad s_2 = 103 \quad s_2^2=10609$  
  
1. $H_0: \frac{\sigma_1^2}{\sigma_2^2} = 1 \quad H_a: \frac{\sigma_1^2}{\sigma_2^2} \neq 1$

2. Set $\alpha = 0.05$.

3. The test statistic and its sampling distribution

   $F_{STAT} = \frac{S_c^2}{S_p^2} \sim F_{n_1-1,n_2-1}$

5. The realized statistic

    $F^* = \frac{12996}{10609}  \approx 1.23$
  
6. The critical value is $F_{14,14,0.025} \approx 2.9786$.  
   The rejection region is { $F$ : $F>2.9786$}.

7. Because $F=1.23$ does not fall into the rejection region,we do not reject $H_0$ , indicating that there is enough evidence to conclude that the two population variances are equal.
