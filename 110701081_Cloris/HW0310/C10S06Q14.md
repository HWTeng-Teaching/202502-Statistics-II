## Solution
## Solution of a

$n_1=30 \quad n_2=30$

1. $H_0: \frac{\sigma_2^2}{\sigma_1^2} = 1 \quad H_a: \frac{\sigma_2^2}{\sigma_1^2} > 1$

2. Set $\alpha = 0.05$.

3. The test statistic and its sampling distribution:

    $F_{\text{STAT}} = \frac{S_2^2}{S_1^2} \sim F_{(n_2-1),(n_1-1)}$

4. The realized statistic:

    $F^* = \frac{28.2^2}{15.6^2} = \frac{795.24}{243.36} \approx 3.27$

5. $p$-value = $P[F>3.27] \approx 0.0011$

6. Since the $p$-value is less than the significance level of $0.05$, we reject $H_0$. This indicates strong evidence that the variability in daily production is significantly greater in the older fabricating system compared to the newer system. As a result, additional maintenance or process improvements may be necessary to ensure stable production output.
