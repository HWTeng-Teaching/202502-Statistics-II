## Solution

### a
$\quad n_1=15 \quad n_2=15$  
  
1. $H_0: \frac{\sigma_2^2}{\sigma_1^2} = 1 \quad H_a: \frac{\sigma_2^2}{\sigma_1^2} \neq 1$  

2. Set $\alpha = 0.05$.  

3. The test statistic and its sampling distribution:  
$F_{\text{STAT}} = \frac{S_2^2}{S_1^2} \sim F_{(n_2-1),(n_1-1)} \Rightarrow F_{14,14}$  

4. Compute the observed test statistic:  
    $F^* = \frac{2.96}{1.54} = 1.92$  

5. The $p$-value is calculated as:  
    $p\text{-value} = 2 \times P[F > 1.92] \approx 2 \times 0.077 = 0.154$  

6. Because $p\text{-value} = 0.154$ is greater than $\alpha = 0.05$, we fail to reject $H_0$. This indicates that there is not enough statistical evidence at the 5% significance level to conclude that the population variances of the two stock prices are significantly different.

### b

To find the 99% confidence interval for the ratio of the two population variances:  

$\left( \frac{S_2^2}{S_1^2} \times \frac{1}{F_{(14,14),0.005}}, \frac{S_2^2}{S_1^2} \times F_{(14,14),0.995} \right)$  

Using the $F$-table:  
$F_{(14,14),0.005} = 4.2993, \quad F_{(14,14),0.995} = 0.2326$  

Substituting values:  
$\left( \frac{2.96}{1.54} \times \frac{1}{4.2993}, \frac{2.96}{1.54} \times 4.2993 \right)$  

$\left( \frac{1.92}{4.2993}, 1.92 \times 4.2993 \right)$  

$\left( 0.45, 8.26 \right)$  

Thus, the 99% confidence interval for the ratio of population variances is **(0.45, 8.26)**. Since this interval contains 1, it supports the conclusion from part (a) that there is no strong evidence suggesting a significant difference in the population variances of the two stock prices.
