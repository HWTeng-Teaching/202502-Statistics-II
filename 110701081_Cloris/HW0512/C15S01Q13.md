## Solution
$H_0$: The two samples come from the same distribution.
$H_1$: The two samples come from different distributions.

For two samples of size $n_1 = n_2 = 9$, the **sum of all ranks** is:

$$
T = R_1 + R_2 = 126 + 45 = 171
$$

Under $H_0$, expected rank sum for group 1:

$$
E(R_1) = \frac{n_1(n_1 + n_2 + 1)}{2} = \frac{9(18 + 1)}{2} = \frac{9 \cdot 19}{2} = 85.5
$$

Standard deviation:

$$
\sigma_{R_1} = \sqrt{\frac{n_1 n_2 (n_1 + n_2 + 1)}{12}} = \sqrt{\frac{9 \cdot 9 \cdot 19}{12}} \approx \sqrt{128.25} \approx 11.33
$$

Compute z-value:

$$
z = \frac{R_1 - E(R_1)}{\sigma_{R_1}} = \frac{126 - 85.5}{11.33} \approx \frac{40.5}{11.33} \approx 3.57
$$

At $\alpha = 0.05$, critical value for two-tailed test is:

- $z_{0.025} = \pm 1.96$

Since $3.57 > 1.96$, we **reject $H_0$**.

**Conclusion:** There is strong evidence that the distributions of eye-movement rates differ between deaf and hearing children.
