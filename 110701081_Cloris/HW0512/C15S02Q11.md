## Solution
Two chefs, A and B, rated 22 meals. The goal is to determine whether one chef tends to give higher ratings than the other using the **sign test** at $\alpha \approx 0.05$.



We compare ratings for each meal:

| Meal | A | B | A − B | Sign |
|------|---|---|-------|------|
| 1    | 6 | 8 | -2    | -    |
| 2    | 8 | 9 | -1    | -    |
| 3    | 7 | 7 |  0    | 0    |
| 4    | 7 | 4 | +3    | +    |
| 5    | 4 | 3 | +1    | +    |
| 6    | 5 | 4 | +1    | +    |
| 7    | 4 | 1 | +3    | +    |
| 8    | 9 | 8 | +1    | +    |
| 9    | 8 | 6 | +2    | +    |
| 10   | 5 | 5 |  0    | 0    |
| 11   | 6 | 6 |  0    | 0    |
| 12   | 5 | 4 | +1    | +    |
| 13   | 4 | 3 | +1    | +    |
| 14   | 6 | 6 |  0    | 0    |
| 15   | 6 | 5 | +1    | +    |
| 16   | 9 | 9 |  0    | 0    |
| 17   | 9 | 8 | +1    | +    |
| 18   | 4 | 5 | -1    | -    |
| 19   | 8 | 9 | -1    | -    |
| 20   | 6 | 7 | -1    | -    |
| 21   | 5 | 4 | +1    | +    |
| 22   | 5 | 5 |  0    | 0    |

- Positive signs (+): 11  
- Negative signs (−): 5  
- Zeros (ties): 6  
- Total used in sign test: $n = 16$ (22 − 6)

Let $x = \min(11, 5) = 5$

### a.

Under $H_0$, $X \sim \text{Binomial}(n = 16, p = 0.5)$

- Two-tailed test: Find $P(X \leq 5)$ and double it.

Using binomial probabilities:

- $P(X \leq 5)$ (from tables or calculator) ≈ 0.105

So:

$$
P = 2 \cdot 0.105 = 0.21
$$

Since $0.21 > \alpha = 0.05$, we **fail to reject $H_0$**.

**Conclusion (a):** No significant difference between the chefs.

### b.

Use normal approximation to binomial:

- $n = 16$
- $\mu = \frac{n}{2} = 8$, $\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{n}{4}} = \sqrt{4} = 2$
- $x = 5$ (observed smaller count)

Apply continuity correction:

$$
z = \frac{5 + 0.5 - 8}{2} = \frac{-2.5}{2} = -1.25
$$

Two-tailed p-value:

- $P = 2 \cdot P(Z < -1.25) = 2 \cdot 0.1056 = 0.2112$

**Conclusion :** Fail to reject $H_0$, same as part (a)

### c.

- Both **exact binomial test** and **z approximation** lead to the **same conclusion**.
- Chef A and Chef B do **not** show a statistically significant difference in their ratings at the 5% level.
