## Solution
Null hypothesis ($H_0$):The populations are the same (median difference = 0)
Alternative hypothesis ($H_1$): The populations are different (two-tailed test)

We compare each pair:

| Pair | Pop 1 | Pop 2 | Difference | Sign |
|------|-------|--------|------------|------|
| 1    | 8.9   | 8.8    | +0.1       | +    |
| 2    | 8.1   | 7.4    | +0.7       | +    |
| 3    | 9.3   | 9.0    | +0.3       | +    |
| 4    | 7.7   | 7.8    | -0.1       | -    |
| 5    |10.4   | 9.9    | +0.5       | +    |
| 6    | 8.3   | 8.1    | +0.2       | +    |
| 7    | 7.4   | 6.9    | +0.5       | +    |

- Number of `+`: 6  
- Number of `-`: 1  
- Number of 0 differences: 0 → **all pairs are used**

Let $x$ be the smaller of the two counts (positives and negatives), so:

$$
x = \min(6,\ 1) = 1,\quad n = 7
$$


This is a **two-tailed test**, so we calculate:

$$
P = 2 \cdot P(X \leq 1) \quad \text{where } X \sim \text{Binomial}(n=7, p=0.5)
$$

Using binomial probabilities:

$P(X = 0) = \binom{7}{0}(0.5)^7 = 0.0078$
$P(X = 1) = \binom{7}{1}(0.5)^7 = 0.0547$

Then:

$$
P = 2 \cdot (0.0078 + 0.0547) = 2 \cdot 0.0625 = 0.125
$$

$P = 0.125 > \alpha = 0.10$
We **fail to reject** the null hypothesis.

**Conclusion:** There is not enough evidence at the 10% level to conclude a significant difference between the two populations.
