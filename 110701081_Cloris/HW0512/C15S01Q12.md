## Solution
### a.
$H_0$: The distributions of DO content are the same.
$H_1$: DO content below town is **lower** than above town.

Sorted combined data (with ranks):

- 4.7 (1), 4.8 (2.5), 4.8 (2.5), 4.9 (4.5), 4.9 (4.5), 4.9 (4.5), 5.0 (7), 5.0 (7), 5.1 (9), 5.2 (10)

Ranks for each group:

- **Above Town:** 2.5, 10, 7, 4.5, 9 → Sum = **33**
- **Below Town:** 7, 1, 4.5, 2.5, 4.5 → Sum = **19.5**

Use Wilcoxon Rank Sum critical values table for $n_1 = n_2 = 5$, one-tailed $\alpha = 0.05$:

- Critical value (lower tail) = **23**

Since the rank sum for Below Town is **19.5 < 23**, we **reject $H_0$**.

**Conclusion:** There is evidence that DO content is significantly **lower below the town**.

### b.
$H_0$: $\mu_{\text{above}} = \mu_{\text{below}}$
$H_1$: $\mu_{\text{above}} > \mu_{\text{below}}$

- $\bar{x}_1 = 5.0$, $s_1 = 0.1581$ (Above Town)
- $\bar{x}_2 = 4.86$, $s_2 = 0.1140$ (Below Town)

Use pooled variance since sample sizes are equal:

$$
t = \frac{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2}{s_p \sqrt{\frac{2}{n}}}
$$

Where:

$$
s_p = \sqrt{\frac{(s_1^2 + s_2^2)}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{(0.0250 + 0.0130)}{2}} = \sqrt{0.019} = 0.1378
$$

Then:

$$
t = \frac{5.0 - 4.86}{0.1378 \cdot \sqrt{2/5}} \approx \frac{0.14}{0.0873} \approx 1.60
$$

$df = 5 + 5 - 2 = 8$
One-tailed critical $t_{0.05,8} = 1.860$

Since $1.60 < 1.860$, we **fail to reject $H_0$**.

**Conclusion:** The t-test does **not** provide enough evidence that DO is lower below the town.
