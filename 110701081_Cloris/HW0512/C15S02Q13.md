## Solution
### a.
$H_0$: The two drugs are equally effective  
$H_1$: One drug is more effective than the other (two-tailed)

Use binomial distribution: $X \sim \text{Binomial}(n=10,\ p=0.5)$

$$
P = 2 \cdot P(X \leq 1)
$$

$P(X=0) = \binom{10}{0}(0.5)^{10} = 0.00098$
$P(X=1) = \binom{10}{1}(0.5)^{10} = 0.00977$

$$
P = 2 \cdot (0.00098 + 0.00977) = 2 \cdot 0.01075 = 0.0215
$$

Conclusion:
Since $0.0215 < 0.05$, we **reject $H_0$**.  
There is **significant evidence** that **Drug B** leads to **higher recovery rates**.


### b.

Using a **Student’s t-test** would be inappropriate for several reasons:

1. **Proportions are not interval-scale** data — they are **bounded (0–100%)**, violating normality assumptions.
2. Sample sizes in each hospital are **not equal**, so variances may not be comparable.
3. The data are **paired** (each hospital gave both drugs), so dependency must be accounted for — and the t-test for independent samples does not.
4. **Distributional assumptions** (normality of differences) are questionable with only 10 data points.
