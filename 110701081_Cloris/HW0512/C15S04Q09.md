## Solution
### a.
$H_0$: The median of the differences is zero (no difference between populations)
$H_1$: The median of the differences is **not** zero (two-tailed test)

- Total number of non-zero differences $n = 7$
- Sum of **positive ranks**: $T_+ = 3 + 6 + 4 + 5 + 2 + 5 = 25$
- Sum of **negative ranks**: $T_- = 3$
- Wilcoxon test statistic: $T = \min(T_+, T_-) = \min(25, 3) = 3$

From Wilcoxon signed-rank table for $n = 7$ at $\alpha = 0.05$ (two-tailed):

Critical value = **2**

Since $T = 3 > 2$, we **fail to reject $H_0$**.

**Conclusion:** There is **no significant difference** between the two populations using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test at $\alpha = 0.05$.

### b.

In Exercise 4 (Sign Test):

- We had 6 positive differences, 1 negative, and 0 ties
- Test statistic: $x = \min(6, 1) = 1$
- Binomial test $P = 0.125 > 0.10$, so we also **failed to reject $H_0$**

Comparison:

- Both tests lead to the **same conclusion**: no significant difference
- However, Wilcoxon Signed-Rank is **more powerful** as it uses **magnitude** of differences, not just signs
