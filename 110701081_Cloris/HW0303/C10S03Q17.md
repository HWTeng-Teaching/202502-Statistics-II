## Solution
## a.
To verify if the variances of the two disinfectants are equal, we perform the F-test. The formula for the F-statistic is:

$$
F = \frac{s_1^2}{s_2^2}
$$

Where:
- $s_1^2 = 2.78095$ (Variance for 95% Ethanol)
- $s_2^2 = 0.17143$ (Variance for 20% Bleach)

Substituting these values into the formula:

$$
F = \frac{2.78095}{0.17143} = 16.22
$$

For an F-distribution with degrees of freedom $(14, 14)$, the critical value at $\alpha = 0.05$ is **2.48**. Since $F = 16.22$ is greater than 2.48, we **reject the null hypothesis** that the variances are equal.

## b.

## Welch’s t-test for Unequal Variances

Since the assumption of equal variances is violated, we proceed with **Welch’s t-test**, which is appropriate when the variances are unequal.

### 1: Hypotheses

- **Null Hypothesis**: $H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2$ (No difference in means)
- **Alternative Hypothesis**: $H_a: \mu_1 \neq \mu_2$ (There is a significant difference)

### 2: Test Statistic

The formula for Welch’s t-test is:

$$
t = \frac{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2}{\sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}}
$$

Where:
- $\bar{x}_1=3.73$ and $\bar{x}_2=4.80$ (sample means)
- $s_1^2=2.78095$ and $s_2^2=0.17143$ (sample variances)
- $n_1 = n_2 = 15$ (sample sizes)

Substituting these values into the formula:

$$
t = \frac{3.73 - 4.80}{\sqrt{\frac{2.78095}{15} + \frac{0.17143}{15}}}
$$

$$
t = \frac{-1.07}{\sqrt{0.1854 + 0.01143}} = \frac{-1.07}{\sqrt{0.19683}} = \frac{-1.07}{0.4435} \approx -2.41
$$

### 3: Degrees of Freedom

To calculate the degrees of freedom, we use Welch’s formula:

$$
df = \frac{\left(\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2} \right)^2}{\frac{(s_1^2 / n_1)^2}{n_1 - 1} + \frac{(s_2^2 / n_2)^2}{n_2 - 1}}
$$

Approximating the degrees of freedom:

$$
df \approx 14
$$

### 4: Critical Value

For a two-tailed test with $\alpha=0.05$ and degrees of freedom $df \approx 14$, the critical value of $t_{0.025, 14}$ is **2.145**.

### 5: Decision

Since the absolute value of the calculated t-statistic $|t|=2.41$ is greater than the critical value $2.145$, we **reject the null hypothesis**.

### 6: Conclusion
There is significant evidence to conclude that **20% bleach** is more effective than **95% ethanol** in preventing contamination in eggplant cuttings.
