## Solution
### 1.Hypotheses
- **Null Hypothesis**:  
  $H_0: \mu_d = 0$  
- **Alternative Hypothesis**:  
  $H_a: \mu_d \neq 0$  

where $\mu_d$ is the mean difference in reaction time (Stimulus 1 - Stimulus 2).
### 2. Compute Sample Statistics
$n = 16, \quad \bar{d} = -0.5625, \quad S_D = 1.1529$  

### 3. Compute the Test Statistic
$t = \frac{\bar{d} - 0}{S_D / \sqrt{n}}$  

Substituting values:  

$t = \frac{-0.5625}{1.1529 / \sqrt{16}} = -1.95$  

### 4. rejection region
For a **two-tailed test** at $\alpha = 0.05$ with **df = 15**, the critical value is:  

$t_{15, 0.025} = 2.131$  

The **rejection region** is:  

$t < -2.131 \quad \text{or} \quad t > 2.131$  


### 5.Conclusion
Because $t = -1.95 > -2.131$, we **fail to reject** $H_0$. There is **not enough evidence** to conclude that the reaction times are significantly different.
