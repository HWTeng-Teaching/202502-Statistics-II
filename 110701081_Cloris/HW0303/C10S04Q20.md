## Solution
Let **With Imagery** and **Without Imagery** be denoted by $W$ and $N$.

We are given **20 students** who recalled words under both conditions. We want to determine whether using imagery improves recall.

### 1.Hypotheses
- **Null Hypothesis**:  
  $H_0: \mu_W - \mu_N = 0$  
- **Alternative Hypothesis**:  
  $H_a: \mu_W - \mu_N > 0$  

where $\mu_W$ and $\mu_N$ are the population means of words recalled **with and without imagery**, respectively.

### 2. Compute Sample Statistics
$n = 20, \quad \bar{d} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{20} (x_{Wi} - x_{Ni})}{20} = \frac{407 - 200}{20} = 10.25$  

$S_D = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{20} ((x_{Wi} - x_{Ni}) - \bar{d})^2}{20-1}} \approx 4.0507$  

where:
- $\bar{d}$ = mean of the paired differences.
- $S_D$ = standard deviation of the paired differences.

---

### 3. Compute the Test Statistic
We use the paired t-test formula:

$t_{STAT} = \frac{\bar{d} - 0}{S_D / \sqrt{n}} \sim t_{(n-1)}$  

Substituting values:

$t^* = \frac{10.25 - 0}{4.0507 / \sqrt{20}} \approx 11.3164$  


### 4. rejection region
For a **one-tailed test** at $\alpha = 0.05$ with **degrees of freedom** $df = n - 1 = 19$, we use the t-table:

$t_{19, 0.05} = 1.729$  

Thus, the **rejection region** is:

$t > 1.729$  


### 5.Conclusion
Because $t^* = 11.3164 > 1.729$, we **reject the null hypothesis** $H_0$. This provides **sufficient statistical evidence** to conclude that **the average recall score is higher when imagery is used**.
