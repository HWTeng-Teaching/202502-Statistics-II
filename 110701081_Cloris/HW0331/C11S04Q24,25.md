## Solution
## 24
### a.

- **Blocks**: Items  
- **Treatments**: Stores  

### b.

We test whether there is a significant difference in average prices between the four stores.

**Hypotheses:**

- $H_0$: $\mu_1 = \mu_2 = \mu_3 = \mu_4$
- $H_a$: At least one mean is different

Let $\alpha = 0.05$

Test statistic:

$$
F = \frac{MS_{\text{store}}}{MS_{\text{error}}} \sim F_{3,21}
$$

Given:

- $F^* = 26.52$
- Critical value: $F_{3,21;0.05} = 3.07$

Since $26.52 > 3.07$, we reject the null hypothesis.

**Conclusion:**  
There is strong evidence that prices differ between at least two of the stores.

### c.

Now we examine whether there is significant variation across items (the blocks), to determine if blocking was effective.

**Hypotheses:**

- $H_0$: All item means are equal
- $H_a$: At least one item mean is different

Let $\alpha = 0.05$

Test statistic:

$$
F = \frac{MS_{\text{item}}}{MS_{\text{error}}} \sim F_{7,21}
$$

Given:

- $F^* = 35.32$
- Critical value: $F_{7,21;0.05} = 2.4876$

Since $35.32 > 2.4876$, we reject $H_0$.

**Conclusion:**  
There are meaningful differences across items.  
This indicates that blocking by item helped control variation, so **blocking was effective**.

## 25
### a.

Number of treatment groups: $k = 4$  
Number of blocks (items): $b = 8$  
Error degrees of freedom: $df_E = 21$

From the studentized range distribution:  
$$
q_{0.05}(4, 21) \approx 3.96
$$


### b.

We calculate the Tukey critical difference using:

$$
\omega = q \cdot \sqrt{\frac{MSE}{b}} = 3.96 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{0.1658}{8}} = 3.96 \cdot \sqrt{0.020725} \approx 3.96 \cdot 0.14396 = \boxed{0.570}
$$


### c.

| Store       | Mean Price |
|-------------|------------|
| WinCo       | 2.68125    |
| Stater Bros | 3.85250    |
| Vons        | 4.13500    |
| Ralphs      | 4.34000    |

| Comparison               | Difference | $\omega = 0.570$ | Significant? |
|--------------------------|------------|------------------|--------------|
| WinCo vs. Ralphs         | 1.65875    | > 0.570          | **Yes**      |
| WinCo vs. Vons           | 1.45375    | > 0.570          | **Yes**      |
| WinCo vs. Stater Bros    | 1.17125    | > 0.570          | **Yes**      |
| Stater Bros vs. Ralphs   | 0.48750    | < 0.570          | No           |
| Stater Bros vs. Vons     | 0.28250    | < 0.570          | No           |
| Vons vs. Ralphs          | 0.20500    | < 0.570          | No           |

---

### Conclusion:

Only **WinCo** has a significantly different mean price compared to the other stores.  
The other store pairs do **not** show significant differences in their average prices at the 0.05 level.
