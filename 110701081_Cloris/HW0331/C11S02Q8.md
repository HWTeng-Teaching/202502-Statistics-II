## Solution
## a.

The total sum of all scores is:

$G = \sum x_{ij} = 840$

The correction term for the total is:

$CM = \frac{G^2}{11} = \frac{840^2}{11} = 64145.45$

Group totals:

$T_A = 380,\quad T_B = 199,\quad T_C = 261$

Total sum of squares:

$SS_{\text{Total}} = 65286 - 64145.45 = 1140.55$

Between-group sum of squares (treatment):

$SS_{\text{Treatment}} = \frac{380^2}{5} + \frac{199^2}{3} + \frac{261^2}{3} - 64145.45 = 641.88$

Within-group sum of squares (error):

$SS_{\text{Error}} = 1140.55 - 641.88 = 498.67$

Compute mean squares:

$MS_{\text{Treatment}} = \frac{641.88}{2} = 320.94$

$MS_{\text{Error}} = \frac{498.67}{8} = 62.33$

Test statistic:

$$
F = \frac{320.94}{62.33} \approx 5.15
$$

## b.

We test the hypothesis:

$H_0: \mu_A = \mu_B = \mu_C$  
$H_a$: Not all group means are equal

Significance level: $\alpha = 0.05$  
Degrees of freedom: numerator = 2, denominator = 8

The critical value from the F-distribution with $(2,8)$ degrees of freedom at the 0.05 level is:

$F_{2,8;0.05} = 4.46$

Since the computed $F$-statistic is:

$$
F = 5.15 > 4.46
$$

We reject the null hypothesis.

**Conclusion:**  
There is statistically significant evidence to suggest that at least one of the treatment methods affects average hostility scores differently from the others.
