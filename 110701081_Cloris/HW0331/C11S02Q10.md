## Solution
## a. 
**Hypotheses:**

- $H_0: \mu_A = \mu_B = \mu_C$
- $H_a:$ At least one mean is different

**Test Statistic:**  
$F = 5.704$  

**P-value:**  
$0.0251$

**Interpretation:**  
Since the p-value is less than 0.05, we reject $H_0$ at the 5% level.  
There is a significant difference in mean assembly times among the three training programs.


## b.

Given:

- $\bar{x}_A = 60.5$, $\bar{x}_B = 54.667$
- $MSE = 14.941$
- $n_A = 4$, $n_B = 3$
- $t_{0.005,\,df=2} = 3.25$

We calculate:

$$\[
(60.5 - 54.667) \pm 3.25 \cdot \sqrt{14.941 \left( \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{3} \right)} = 5.833 \pm 9.595
\]$$

**CI:**  
$$\[
-3.762 < \mu_A - \mu_B < 15.428
\]$$


## c. 

$$
\bar{x}_A \pm t\_{0.005;3} * \sqrt{\frac{14.941}{4}}  
= 60.5 \pm 6.281
$$

**CI:**  
$$\[
54.219 < \mu_A < 66.781
\]$$


## d.

Since the measurements represent averages of four assembly times, and time is a continuous random variable, the **Central Limit Theorem** ensures that even for small sample sizes, the distribution of average assembly times is approximately normal.
