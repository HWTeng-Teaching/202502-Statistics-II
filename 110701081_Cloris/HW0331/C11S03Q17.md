## Solution
## a.

We are testing whether the mean GRE scores differ across the three graduate programs using a one-way ANOVA.

Given from the summary:

- Total Sum of Squares: $SS_{\text{Total}} = 300736.67$
- Treatment Sum of Squares: $SS_{\text{Treatment}} = 74806.67$
- Error Sum of Squares:  
  $SS_{\text{Error}} = 300736.67 - 74806.67 = 225930.00$

Degrees of freedom:

- Between groups: $df_1 = k - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2$
- Within groups: $df_2 = n - k = 30 - 3 = 27$
- Total: $df = 29$

Mean squares:

- $MS_{\text{Treatment}} = \frac{74806.67}{2} = 37403.34$
- $MS_{\text{Error}} = \frac{225930}{27} = 8367.78$

Test statistic:

$$
F = \frac{MS_{\text{Treatment}}}{MS_{\text{Error}}} = \frac{37403.34}{8367.78} \approx 4.4699
$$

Critical value at $\alpha = 0.05$ with $(2, 27)$ degrees of freedom:  
$F_{2,27;0.05} \approx 3.35$

Since $F = 4.4699 > 3.35$, we reject the null hypothesis.

### **Conclusion:**
There is significant evidence at the 5% level to conclude that at least one of the programs has a different mean GRE score.


## b.

We are estimating the difference in population means:

$\mu_{\text{Life}} - \mu_{\text{Physical}}$

Given:
- $\bar{x}_{\text{Life}} = 608$
- $\bar{x}_{\text{Physical}} = 653$
- $n_1 = n_2 = 10$
- $MSE = 8367.78$
- $t_{0.025, 29} = 2.05$

$$
(\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2) \pm t^* \cdot \sqrt{\frac{MSE}{n_1} + \frac{MSE}{n_2}}
$$

$$
= (608 - 653) \pm 2.05 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{8367.78}{10} + \frac{8367.78}{10}} 
= -45 \pm 2.05 \cdot \sqrt{1673.56}
$$

$$
= -45 \pm 2.05 \cdot 40.73 
= -45 \pm 83.36
$$


### Final 95% Confidence Interval:

$$
(-128.36,\ 38.36)
$$

**Interpretation:**  
Since 0 lies within the confidence interval, there is **no significant difference** in mean GRE scores between Life Sciences and Physical Sciences programs at the 95% level.

## c. 

We apply Tukey's method to determine which group means differ significantly.

Given:
- $MSE = 8367.78$
- $n = 10$
- $q_{0.05, 3, 27} = 3.506$



$$
\omega = q \cdot \sqrt{\frac{MSE}{n}} = 3.506 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{8367.78}{10}} = 3.506 \cdot \sqrt{836.78} \approx 3.506 \cdot 28.93 \approx 101.42
$$

This is the **minimum difference** required for a pair of means to be significantly different at $\alpha = 0.05$.


### Compare group mean differences:

- $|\bar{x}_L - \bar{x}_P| = |608 - 653| = 45$
- $|\bar{x}_L - \bar{x}_S| = |608 - 538| = 70$
- $|\bar{x}_P - \bar{x}_S| = |653 - 538| = 115$

### Conclusion:

- The difference between **Physical Sciences and Social Sciences** ($115 > 101.42$) **is significant**.
- Other comparisons do **not** exceed the threshold.

Therefore, only the **Physical vs. Social Sciences** comparison shows a statistically significant difference in average GRE scores at $\alpha = 0.05$.
