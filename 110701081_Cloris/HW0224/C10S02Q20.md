## Solution
$\mu=74$ &emsp; 
$n=25$ &emsp;
$\bar{x}=69.7$ &emsp;
$s=16$

1. $H_0:\mu=74$ &emsp; $H_1:\mu\neq74$
2. Set  $\alpha=0.05$
3. Test statistic and its distribution: $t_{STAT}=\frac{\bar{X}-74}{S/\sqrt{n}}\sim t_{24}$
4. Realized statistic, $t^*=\frac{69.7-74}{16/\sqrt{25}}=-1.34375\approx-1.3344$
5. Because the critical value is $t_{24;0.025}=2.064$, the rejection region (R.R) is:
R.R.={t: t> 2.064, t<-2.064}. 
6. $\because$ $t=-1.344 \notin$ R.R., we do not reject* $H_0$ *at* $\alpha=0.05$.
   There is not enough evidence to show that the average CBF for stroke patients is different from that of healthy individuals.
