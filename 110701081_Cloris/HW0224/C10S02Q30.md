# Solution
## a.
$\bar{x} = 20.3$  
s = 5  
n = 21  
1. $H_0$ : $\mu = 25 \quad H_a$ : $\mu \lt 25$
2. Set $\alpha = 0.05$
3. $t_{STAT} = \frac{\bar{X} - 25}{S / \sqrt{n}} \sim t_{(21-1)}$
4. $t^* = \frac{20.3 - 25}{5 / \sqrt{21}}$
=  $\frac{-4.7}{5 / 4.582} = \frac{-4.7}{1.091} \approx -4.308$
5. $( t_{20,0.05} = -1.725 \)$ ,and the rejection region: $ \{t: t < -1.725\}$. 
6. Because -1.725>-4.308, we will reject $H_0$ ,So there's enough evidence that the true pretreatment mean is less than 25.

## b.
$\bar{x} = 26.6$ 
s = 7.4  
n = 21  
$t_{20;0.025} = 2.086$  

$CI = 26.6 \pm 2.086 \times \frac{7.4}{\sqrt{21}}$
$= 26.6 \pm 2.086 \times 1.615$
$= 26.6 \pm 3.368$

$CI \approx (23.232, 29.968)$

The 95% confidence interval for the true posttreatment mean is (23.232, 29.968)

## c.
The mean increased from 20.3 to 26.6, and the 95% CI (23.232, 29.968) excludes 25, indicating a significant improvement. This suggests the treatment may have had a positive effect on self-esteem.
