## Solution
### a.
| Group | Rank Sum |
| ----- | -------- |
| 10–19 | 263      |
| 20–39 | 210      |
| 40–59 | 228      |
| 60–69 | 239      |
Total sample size: $n = 40$

Group sizes: $n_1 = n_2 = n_3 = n_4 = 10$

Significance level: $\alpha = 0.05$

Hypotheses:

$H_0$: The distributions of the four groups are identical

$H_a$: At least one distribution differs

Test statistic:

$$
H_{STAT} = \frac{12}{n(n+1)} \sum \frac{T_i^2}{n_i} - 3(n+1) \sim \chi^2_{(k-1)}
$$

Realized statistic:

$$
H = \frac{12}{40(40+1)} (\frac{263^2}{10}+\frac{210^2}{10}+\frac{228^2}{10}+\frac{239^2}{10})-3(40+1) \approx 39.6
$$

Rejection region: $\\{ \chi^2 | \chi^2 >\chi^2_{3;0.01} \approx 11.345 \\}$

Since $H = 39.6 > 7.815$, we reject $H_0$, concluding that there is a significant difference in the distributions of the four price groups.

### b.
Given:

$F_{\text{observed}} = 18.26$

$\alpha = 0.05$, and $p \ll 0.05$

Since the observed $F$ value is much greater than the critical value and $p$ is very small, we reject $H_0$.
This also suggests a significant difference among group means.

### c.
$$
SSB = \sum n_i (\bar{\chi_i} - \bar{X}_{\text{total}})^2 = 10 \left[ (30.9-29.025)^2 + \cdots + (28.2-29.025)^2 \right] = 10 \times 8.945 = 89.45
$$

$$
SST = SSB + SSW = 89.45 + 800 = 889.45
$$  

$$
MSB = \frac{SSB}{k-1} = \frac{89.45}{3} = 29.82
$$

$$
MSW = \frac{SSW}{N-k} = \frac{800}{36} = 22.22
$$ 

$$
F = \frac{MSB}{MSW} = \frac{29.82}{22.22} \approx 1.34 < 4.38 = critical ~ value
$$

Critical value for $F_{3,36; 0.05} \approx 2.87$ 

Since $F = 1.34 < 2.87$, we fail to reject $H_0$

We fail to reject $H_0$ based on ANOVA ($F = 0.87$, $p = 0.468$).
The Kruskal-Wallis test ($H = 16.89$, $p < 0.01$) suggests a significant difference, likely because it does not assume normality and is more robust to outliers, making it more suitable for heart rate data.
