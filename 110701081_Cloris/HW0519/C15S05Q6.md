## Solution
| Rank | 0.5 |  1  | 1.5 |  2  |
| :--: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|      |  13 |  16 |  2  |  2  |
|      |  20 |  10 | 7.5 |  10 |
|      |  16 |  5  |  10 |  5  |
|      |  19 |  13 |  13 |  5  |
|      |  18 |  16 | 7.5 |  2  |

$T_1 = 13 + 20 + 16 + 19 + 18 = 86$

$T_2 = 16 + 10 + 5 + 13 + 16 = 61$

$T_3 = 2 + 7.5 + 10 + 13 + 7.5 = 41.5$

$T_4 = 2 + 10 + 5 + 5 + 2 = 26$

Let $n = 20$ (total number of observations), and $k = 4$ (number of groups).

Hypothesis
$H_0$: The four groups follow identical distributions

$H_a$: At least one distribution is different

Significance level: $\alpha = 0.01$

Test statistic:

$$
H_{STAT} = \frac{12}{n(n+1)} \sum \frac{T_i^2}{n_i} - 3(n+1) \sim \chi^2_{(k-1)}
$$

Realized staistic:

$$
H^* = \frac{12}{20(20+1)} \* (\frac{86^2}{5} + \frac{61^2}{5} + \frac{41.5^2}{5} + \frac{26^2}{5}) - 3(20+1) \approx 12.09
$$

Rejection region: $\\{ \chi^2 | \chi^2 >\chi^2_{3;0.01} \approx 11.345 \\}$

There is sufficient evidence at the 0.01 significance level to conclude that at least one of the four instructional time groups differs significantly in distribution from the others.
