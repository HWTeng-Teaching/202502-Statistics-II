## Solution
# 📐 Armspan and Height Analysis

This project investigates Leonardo da Vinci’s claim that a person’s **armspan is roughly equal to their height**, using real-world measurements from 8 individuals.

## 📊 Dataset

| Person | Armspan (cm) | Height (cm) |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| 1      | 172          | 175         |
| 2      | 158          | 157         |
| 3      | 165          | 165         |
| 4      | 176          | 177         |
| 5      | 172          | 170         |
| 6      | 175          | 170         |
| 7      | 157          | 160         |
| 8      | 153          | 157         |

## 🔹 a. Scatterplot for Armspan vs Height

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Data
armspan = [172, 158, 165, 176, 172, 175, 157, 153]
height = [175, 157, 165, 177, 170, 170, 160, 157]

# Scatter plot
plt.figure(figsize=(6,6))
plt.scatter(armspan, height, color='blue', edgecolors='black')
plt.xlabel('Armspan (cm)')
plt.ylabel('Height (cm)')
plt.title('Armspan vs Height')
plt.grid(True)
plt.gca().set_aspect('equal')  # Equal scale
plt.show()

The scatterplot shows a strong positive linear relationship. Points are closely clustered around the line y = x, supporting da Vinci's idea that armspan ≈ height.

🔹 b. Expected Slope if da Vinci is Correct
If a person's armspan is equal to their height, then:
slope (b) = 1
This means for every 1 cm increase in armspan, height should increase by 1 cm.

🔹 c. Regression Line: Predicting Height from Armspan
import numpy as np

# Regression calculation
x = np.array(armspan)
y = np.array(height)

# Fit line: y = bx + a
b, a = np.polyfit(x, y, 1)

print(f"Regression equation: Height = {b:.3f} * Armspan + {a:.3f}")
Regression equation: Height = 0.937 * Armspan + 10.433

📌 Conclusion:
The slope b = 0.937 is close to 1, confirming da Vinci’s claim is approximately true. The relationship is strong but not perfect.

🔹 d. Predict Height for Armspan = 157 cm
# Predict height when armspan = 157 cm
armspan_input = 157
predicted_height = b * armspan_input + a
print(f"Predicted height: {predicted_height:.2f} cm")

Predicted height: 157.27 cm

🧠 Final Summary
The data shows a strong linear relationship between armspan and height.

The regression slope is close to 1, supporting da Vinci’s theory.

A person with a 157 cm armspan is predicted to be about 157.27 cm tall.
