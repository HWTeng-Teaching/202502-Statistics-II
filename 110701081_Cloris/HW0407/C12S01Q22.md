## Solution
📊 a. Scatterplot and Relationship
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

armspan = [172, 158, 165, 176, 172, 175, 157, 153]
height = [175, 157, 165, 177, 170, 170, 160, 157]

plt.scatter(armspan, height)
plt.xlabel('Armspan (cm)')
plt.ylabel('Height (cm)')
plt.title('Scatterplot of Armspan vs Height')
plt.grid(True)
plt.axis('equal')  # Same scale for x and y axes
plt.show()

Relationship: The points lie close to the line y = x, indicating a strong linear relationship. This supports da Vinci's claim.

📐 b. If da Vinci is correct, what should the slope be?
Relationship: The points lie close to the line y = x, indicating a strong linear relationship. This supports da Vinci's claim.If Armspan ≈ Height, the slope of the regression line should be:

slope (b) = 1

📈 c. Calculate the regression line
Step 1: Use NumPy to compute regression
import numpy as np

x = np.array(armspan)
y = np.array(height)

# Regression coefficients
b, a = np.polyfit(x, y, 1)

# Regression line equation
print(f"Regression line: Height = {b:.3f} * Armspan + {a:.3f}")
Regression line: Height = 0.937 * Armspan + 10.433
Step 2: Interpretation
The slope b = 0.937 is very close to 1, which supports da Vinci’s hypothesis that armspan and height are roughly equal.

✅ d. Predict Height for Armspan = 157 cm
Step 1: Use regression line
armspan_input = 157
height_prediction = b * armspan_input + a
print(f"Predicted height: {height_prediction:.2f} cm")
Predicted height: 157.27 cm
Step 2: Interpretation
A person with an armspan of 157 cm is predicted to have a height of ~157.27 cm, confirming the idea that height ≈ armspan.

✅ Final Conclusion
The data analysis supports Leonardo da Vinci’s claim. There is a strong linear relationship between armspan and height, and the regression line slope is very close to 1.
