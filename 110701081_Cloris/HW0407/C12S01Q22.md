## Solution
# 📏 Armspan and Height Analysis

Leonardo da Vinci claimed that a person’s armspan is roughly equal to their height. In this analysis, we test that idea with data from 8 individuals.

## 📊 Data

| Person | Armspan (cm) | Height (cm) |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| 1      | 172          | 175         |
| 2      | 158          | 157         |
| 3      | 165          | 165         |
| 4      | 176          | 177         |
| 5      | 172          | 170         |
| 6      | 175          | 170         |
| 7      | 157          | 160         |
| 8      | 153          | 157         |

## a. 🔍 Scatterplot and Relationship
![scatterplot_armspan_height](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2287ed55-807a-42c6-9b52-c634a7715b47)
Here’s the scatterplot again, showing the relationship between armspan and height:

🔴 Red line: Least-squares regression line (best fit)

⚪ Gray dashed line: Reference line (y = x), representing Da Vinci’s claim

📌 Points: Individual data for 8 people

There appears to be a **positive linear relationship** between armspan and height. In general, individuals with greater armspans tend to be taller. The values are relatively close in magnitude, suggesting a strong association and possibly even a 1:1 proportion in some cases.


---

## b. 📐 Interpreting the Slope
If Leonardo da Vinci's claim is true (that armspan ≈ height), then the relationship between the two should be linear with a slope of approximately 1.

This means for every additional 1 cm of armspan, a person would be expected to be 1 cm taller — indicating a 1:1 proportion.

✅ So, we expect the slope to be near 1 if the claim holds.

---

## c. 📈 Regression Line Calculation

We use the least-squares method to calculate the regression line:

Step 1: Compute intermediate values
S_xy = Σ(xy) - (Σx * Σy) / n
     = 221414 - (1328 * 1331) / 8
     = 468

S_xx = Σ(x²) - (Σx)² / n
     = 221016 - (1328²) / 8
     = 568

Step 2: Calculate slope and intercept
 b = S_xy / S_xx = 468 / 568 = 0.8239

Mean of x (x̄) = Σx / n = 1328 / 8 = 166

Mean of y (ȳ) = Σy / n = 1331 / 8 = 166.375

a = ȳ - b * x̄ = 166.375 - 0.8239 * 166 = 29.6

Regression equation:
ŷ = 29.6 + 0.8239x

✅ This line gives the best linear prediction for height based on armspan.

## d. 🔮 Predicting Height for Armspan = 157 cm
Use the regression equation from (c):
ŷ = 29.6 + 0.8239 * 157
  = 158.95
✅ A person with an armspan of 157 cm is predicted to have a height of 158.95 cm
