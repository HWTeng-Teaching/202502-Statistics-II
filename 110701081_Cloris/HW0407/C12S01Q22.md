## Solution
# 📏 Armspan and Height Analysis

Leonardo da Vinci claimed that a person’s armspan is roughly equal to their height. In this analysis, we test that idea with data from 8 individuals.

## 📊 Data

| Person | Armspan (cm) | Height (cm) |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| 1      | 172          | 175         |
| 2      | 158          | 157         |
| 3      | 165          | 165         |
| 4      | 176          | 177         |
| 5      | 172          | 170         |
| 6      | 175          | 170         |
| 7      | 157          | 160         |
| 8      | 153          | 157         |

## a. 🔍 Scatterplot and Relationship
![scatterplot_armspan_height](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2287ed55-807a-42c6-9b52-c634a7715b47)
Here’s the scatterplot again, showing the relationship between armspan and height:

🔴 Red line: Least-squares regression line (best fit)

⚪ Gray dashed line: Reference line (y = x), representing Da Vinci’s claim

📌 Points: Individual data for 8 people

There appears to be a **positive linear relationship** between armspan and height. In general, individuals with greater armspans tend to be taller. The values are relatively close in magnitude, suggesting a strong association and possibly even a 1:1 proportion in some cases.


---

## b. 📐 Expected Slope

If da Vinci is correct and armspan ≈ height, the regression line should be:

\[
\hat{y} = x
\]

✅ So the expected **slope = 1**

---

## c. 📈 Regression Line Calculation

We use the least-squares regression formulas:

\[
S_{xy} = \sum xy - \frac{\sum x \sum y}{n} = 221414 - \frac{1328 \times 1331}{8} = 468
\]

\[
S_{xx} = \sum x^2 - \frac{(\sum x)^2}{n} = 221016 - \frac{1328^2}{8} = 568
\]

\[
b = \frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}} = \frac{468}{568} = 0.8239
\]

\[
\bar{x} = \frac{1328}{8} = 166, \quad \bar{y} = \frac{1331}{8} = 166.375
\]

\[
a = \bar{y} - b\bar{x} = 166.375 - (0.8239)(166) = 29.6
\]

So the **regression line** is:

\[
\hat{y} = 29.6 + 0.8239x
\]

---

## d. 🔮 Prediction for Armspan = 157 cm

\[
\hat{y} = 29.6 + 0.8239 \times 157 = 158.95
\]

✅ A person with an **armspan of 157 cm** is predicted to have a **height of 158.95 cm**

## ✅ Conclusion

- The slope (0.8239) is **close to 1**, supporting da Vinci's idea.
- There's a **strong positive linear relationship**.
- The prediction model performs well using just armspan.
