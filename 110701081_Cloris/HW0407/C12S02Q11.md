## Solution
A researcher collected the following data on the number of books Professor Asimov published and the time it took to write them:

| Number of Books (x) | Time in Months (y) |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| 100                 | 237                |
| 200                 | 350                |
| 300                 | 419                |
| 400                 | 465                |
| 490                 | 507                |

## a. ðŸ“ˆ Least-Squares Regression Line

We assume a linear relationship of the form:
Å· = a + bx
Using least-squares regression, we calculate:

- **Slope (b)** = 0.6701  
- **Intercept (a)** = 195.90  

**Regression Equation:**
Å· = 195.90 + 0.6701x

## b. ðŸŸ¦ Scatterplot with Regression Line

Below is a scatterplot showing the data points and the best-fit regression line:

> The relationship appears to be **strongly linear and positive**â€”as the number of books increases, the time required also increases.

> ## c. ðŸ“Š ANOVA Table for the Linear Regression

| Source     | df | Sum of Squares (SS) | Mean Square (MS) | F       | p-value |
|------------|----|---------------------|------------------|---------|---------|
| Regression | 1  | 43146.93            | 43146.93         | 69.58   | 0.0036  |
| Residual   | 3  | 1860.27             | 620.09           |         |         |
| **Total**  | 4  | 45007.20            |                  |         |         |

## âœ… Conclusion

- The regression line provides a good fit.
- The **F-statistic = 69.58** and **p-value = 0.0036**, indicating that the model is statistically significant.
- The positive slope confirms that as more books are written, the time taken increases.
