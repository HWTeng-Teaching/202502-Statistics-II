## Solution
a. Least-Squares Regression Line

From the regression output:

Intercept = 93.617

Slope = -1.251

Equation of the least-squares regression line:

ŷ = 93.617 - 1.251x

Where:

x = Group median age

ŷ = Predicted % of prisoners re-arrested

b. Hypothesis Test for Linearity

We are testing:

H₀: β = 0 (no linear relationship)

H₁: β ≠ 0 (linear relationship exists)

t-statistic = -10.471

Degrees of Freedom = 5

p-value = 0.000

✅ Since p-value < 0.05, we reject H₀. There is strong evidence of a linear relationship between median age and recidivism rate.

c. 95% Confidence Interval for Slope

From the regression output:

Slope = -1.251

Standard Error = 0.120

Confidence Interval: (-1.559, -0.943)

✅ Interpretation: We are 95% confident that for each additional year in median age, the recidivism rate decreases by between 0.943% and 1.559%.

d. Coefficient of Determination (R²)

R² = 0.9564

✅ Interpretation: 95.64% of the variation in recidivism rates is explained by the group median age. This indicates the regression model provides an excellent fit.
