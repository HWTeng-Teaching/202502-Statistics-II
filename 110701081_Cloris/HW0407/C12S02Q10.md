## Solution
🧮 Body Mass Index and Income
a. 🔍 Variable Roles
If the researcher thinks that BMI is a function of income, this means:

Independent variable (x): Income

Dependent variable (y): BMI

This is because we are using income to predict BMI.

b. 📈 Least-Squares Regression Line
We fit a linear regression model of the form:
ŷ = a + b * x
Where:

Intercept a = 32.91

Slope b = -0.1476
ŷ = 32.91 - 0.1476 * Income
✅ This indicates that for every additional $1,000 increase in income, BMI decreases by approximately 0.15.

c. 📊 ANOVA Table for the Linear Regression Model

| Source      | df | SS      | MS     | F      | p-value |
|-------------|----|---------|--------|--------|---------|
| Regression  | 1  | 59.49   | 59.49  | 18.72  | 0.0125  |
| Error       | 4  | 12.71   | 3.18   |        |         |
| **Total**   | 5  | 72.20   |        |        |         |

SS (Sum of Squares):

Regression SS: ~59.49

Error SS: ~12.71

Total SS: ~72.20

MS (Mean Square):

Regression MS = 59.49 (SS/df for regression)

Error MS = 3.18 (SS/df for error)

F-value:

F = Regression MS / Error MS ≈ 18.72

The p-value of 0.0125 indicates that the regression model is statistically significant at the 5% level.

This table summarizes the ANOVA results for the regression of BMI on Income.
