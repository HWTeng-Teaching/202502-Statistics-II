## Solution
ðŸ“Š Question 9: Lots of Highways
a. Scatterplot and Trend
We plot the number of miles of U.S. urban roadways over time (2000â€“2015):

Pattern:
There is a clear positive linear trend. As the years increase, the number of miles of roadways tends to increase steadily, indicating a strong linear relationship.

b. Least-Squares Regression Line

Regression Equation:

yÌ‚ = 0.8681 + 0.0231x

Where:

x: Years since 2000

Å·: Predicted urban roadway miles (in millions)

Regression Statistics:

Slope = 0.0231

Intercept = 0.8681

Correlation coefficient (r) = 0.9861

Coefficient of determination (rÂ²) = 0.9725

Standard error = 0.00104

t-statistic = 22.23

Degrees of freedom = 14

p-value = 2.55e-12 âœ… Highly significant

Conclusion: Since p < 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. There is strong evidence of a linear relationship between year and roadway mileage.

c. ANOVA Table
| Source     | df  | SS      | MS      | F       |
|------------|-----|---------|---------|---------|
| Regression | 1   | 0.1712  | 0.1712  | 560.90  |
| Error      | 14  | 0.0043  | 0.0003  |         |
| Total      | 15  | 0.1755  |         |         |

 F = tÂ² = 22.23Â² = 494.37 âœ…

 d. Coefficient of Determination (rÂ²)
rÂ² = 0.9725

Interpretation: 97.25% of the variation in roadway mileage is explained by the year. This indicates a very effective linear regression model.
