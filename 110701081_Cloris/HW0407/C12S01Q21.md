## Solution
# 📏 How Long Is It? — Linear Regression Analysis

This project performs a **least-squares linear regression** to determine how well a subject can estimate object sizes. The subject was shown 10 objects and asked to estimate their lengths or diameters. Actual measurements were then recorded.

## 📐 Regression Formula

We use the least-squares method to find the best-fit line:

**Formula:**
ŷ = b * x + a

Where:
- **x** = Estimated value
- **ŷ** = Predicted actual value
- **b** = Slope
- **a** = Intercept

## 🧮 Calculations

Using the formulas:
x̄ = 26.49 ȳ = 27.2

Sxx = ∑(x - x̄)² = 7918.169 Sxy = ∑(x - x̄)(y - ȳ) = 7717.13

b = Sxy / Sxx = 0.9746 a = ȳ - b * x̄ = 1.3826

The final regression line is:
ŷ = 0.9746x + 1.3826

## 📈 Plot

A scatter plot of the estimated vs actual measurements with the regression line added shows that the data generally follows a strong linear trend.

## 📌 Conclusion

- The slope is close to 1, indicating strong estimation accuracy.
- The regression line fits the data well.
- A linear relationship between estimated and actual sizes is reasonable based on the visualized trend.
