## Solution

An experiment was conducted to study the relationship between the dependent variable \( y \) (texture of strawberries) and the independent variable \( x \) (coded storage temperature). The data are:

| \(x\)  | -2 | -2 |  0 |  2 |  2 |
|--------|----|----|----|----|----|
| \(y\)  | 4.0 | 3.5 | 2.0 | 0.5 | 0.0 |

We fit a linear regression model:

$$
\hat{y} = a + bx
$$


### a.

Estimate the expected value of \( y \) when \( x = -1 \)** using a 99% confidence interval.

We calculate:

$$
\hat{y} = a + b(-1) = 2.875
$$

The 99% confidence interval is:

$$
\boxed{(2.01,\ 3.74)}
$$


### b.

Predict the texture value for a single observation when \( x = 1 \) using a 99% prediction interval.

Prediction:

$$
\hat{y} = a + b(1) = 1.125
$$

The 99% prediction interval is:

$$
\boxed{(-0.77,\ 3.02)}
$$


### c.


The width of the prediction interval is minimized when:

$$
(x_0 - \bar{x})^2 = 0
$$

Thus:

$$
x_0 = \bar{x} = 0
$$

The prediction interval is narrowest at $x_0$ = 0.
