## Solution

### a.

We are interested in understanding how **calories (independent variable)** predict or explain **total fat content (dependent variable)**. Therefore, a **linear regression analysis** is appropriate, as it allows us to model the relationship and make predictions.

### b.
We perform a linear regression with:

- Independent variable \( x \): Calories  
- Dependent variable \( y \): Total fat (grams)

From the regression analysis, we obtain:

Regression equation:
  $\hat{y} = -10.418 + 0.092x$

  Correlation coefficient: $r = 0.919$<br>
  Coefficient of determination: $r^2 = 0.844$<br>
  p-value: $p = 0.0034$<br>
This result shows that as the calorie content increases, the total fat also tends to increase in a consistent and predictable way. In other words, Coldstone Creamery’s higher-calorie ice cream flavors are likely to have higher fat content as well.
