## Solution
The residual plots do not indicate any major violations of regression assumptions.
In the normal probability plot, the residuals generally follow a straight line, suggesting that the normality assumption is reasonably satisfied.
The residuals vs. fitted values plot shows no clear patterns or systematic structure, supporting the assumptions of linearity and constant variance.
Therefore, the regression model appears appropriate for the data.
