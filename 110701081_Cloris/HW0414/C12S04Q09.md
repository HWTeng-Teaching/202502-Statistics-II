## Solution
### a. 
The coefficient of determination, 
$r^2$=0.027, indicates that only 2.7% of the variability in TV prices can be explained by the screen size.

This is a very weak linear relationship, suggesting that screen size is not a strong predictor of price. Other factors (e.g., brand, features, resolution) may play a more significant role in determining the price.

### b. 
Normal Probability Plot:
The residuals approximately follow a straight line, suggesting the normality assumption is reasonably satisfied.

Residuals vs Fitted Plot:
The residuals do not appear to be randomly scattered; instead, they show a pattern, particularly funnel-shaped variance (i.e., some fanning out), indicating non-constant variance (heteroscedasticity).

Therefore, the assumption of equal variance (homoscedasticity) appears to be violated.

### c. Violation Based on Scatterplot and Regression Fit
A scatterplot of price vs. screen size would likely show a weak pattern or even a non-linear or dispersed relationship, confirming the low 
$r^2$ value.

The assumption that has been violated is the linearity assumption. The relationship between screen size and price is not linear, and a linear model does not fit the data well.
