## Solution

### a
<img width="563" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2abb6130-da1b-43d8-bb63-e1461849f638" />

Yes. A scatterplot of the data would show that as the amount of phosphorus applied to the soil increases, the phosphorus levels in the plant also tend to increase. The trend appears approximately linear.

### b
Let the best fitting line be $\hat{y} =  a + bx$
$b = \frac{SXY}{SXX} = \frac{88.4667}{0.3267} = 270.82$
$a = \bar{y}-b\bar{x} =  80.85$

$$
\hat{y} = 80.9 + 270.8x
$$

Where:

$$
\hat{y} \text{: predicted phosphorus level in the plant} \\
x \text{: phosphorus applied to the soil (in } \mu mol \text{)}
$$


### c.

$$
H_0: \beta = 0 \quad \text{(no linear relationship)} \\
H_a: \beta \ne 0 \quad \text{(a linear relationship exists)}
$$

From the regression output:

- T-statistic: $$3.96$$  
- P-value: $$0.003$$

Since:

$$
p = 0.003 < 0.05
$$

We reject the null hypothesis.There is statistically significant evidence of a linear relationship between the amount of phosphorus applied and the amount absorbed by the plant.

### d

$$
\hat{y} = 135.015
$$

$t_{n-2,0.1} = t_{10,0.1} = 1.812$

$x_0 = 0.20$

$SE_{\hat{y}} = s \cdot \sqrt{ \frac{1}{n} + \frac{(x_0 - \bar{x})^2}{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2} } = 12.6264$
$s=\sqrt{\frac{\sum (y_i - \hat{y_i})^2}{n-2}} = 39.04190$

90% CI = $(112.130, 157.900)$
