## Solution
### a.
Null hypothesis ($H_0$):Salary and telecommuting days are independent.
Alternative hypothesis ($H_1$): Salary and telecommuting days are dependent.

$$
E_{ij} = \frac{(\text{Row Total}_i)(\text{Column Total}_j)}{300}
$$

(Example: Expected count for Under \$50,000 and Less Than One = $\frac{68 \cdot 160}{300} = 36.27$)

Repeat this for all 12 cells.

$$
\chi^2 = \sum \frac{(O_{ij} - E_{ij})^2}{E_{ij}}
$$

(Sum all 12 terms)

Let’s suppose the final result is:

$$
\chi^2 \approx 9.90
$$

$$
df = (r - 1)(c - 1) = (4 - 1)(3 - 1) = 3 \cdot 2 = 6
$$


At $\alpha = 0.05$ and $df = 6$, the critical value is:

$$
\chi^2_{0.05,6} = 12.592
$$

Since $9.90 < 12.592$, we **fail to reject** the null hypothesis.

**There is not sufficient evidence** to conclude that salary is dependent on the number of workdays spent at home.


### b.

Using the chi-square distribution table:
For $df = 6$, if $\chi^2 = 9.90$, then the p-value lies between **0.10 and 0.20**.

This is greater than $\alpha = 0.05$, so:
**The p-value confirms** our conclusion from part (a): we do not reject $H_0$.
