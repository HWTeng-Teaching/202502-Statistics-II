# Solution
$H_0$ : $\mu = 74 \quad H_a$ : $\mu \neq 74$    
$\alpha = 0.05$  
n = 25  
s = 16  
$t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{s/ \sqrt{n}} = \frac{69.7-74}{16/\sqrt{25}} \approx -1.344$  
It's two-tails so $t_{\alpha / 2} \Rightarrow t_{n-1=24;0.025}=2.064$   
The rejection region are t > 2.064 and t < -2.064  
Therefore -1.344 is not in the rejection region, the answer is non-reject.
