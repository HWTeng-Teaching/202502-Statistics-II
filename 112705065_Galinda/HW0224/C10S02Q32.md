# Question

# Solution
## a.

the 95% CI means we are 95% sure that the mean is in (0.9867, 1.1178)  
we can set the $\alpha = 0.05$  
because p-value = 0.113 < 0.05  
we will reject $H_0$ : $\mu = 1$  
## b.

$t = \frac{\bar{x}-\mu}{s/\sqrt{n}} = \frac{1.0522-1}{0.1657/\sqrt{27}} \approx 1.64$   
$t_{26, 0.025} = 2.056$  
$SE = 0.0319$  
$UCL = 1.0522 + 2.056 \times 0.0319 \approx 1.1178$  
$LCL = 1.0522 - 2.056 \times 0.0319 \approx 0.9866$  
The answer is (0.9866, 1.1178)
