# Question

# Solution

## a.
Step 1: $H_0: \frac{\sigma_{1}^2}{\sigma_{2}^2} = 1, H_{a}: \frac{\sigma_{1}^2}{\sigma_{2}^2} < 1$  

Step 2: We set the $\alpha = 0.05$

Step 3: $F_{\text{stat}} = \frac{S_{1}^2}{S_{2}^2} \sim F_{n_1-1,n_2-1}$  

Step 4: $F^{*} = \frac{15.6^2}{28.2^2} = 0.306$  

Step 5: We are going to find the p-value, and that is 0.001(I ask ChatGPT tp help me on this...)  

Step 6: Because $\alpha$ > p-value, we reject $H_0$.  

In conclution, there is a sufficient evidence that the variability increased the maintainence of older fabricating system.
