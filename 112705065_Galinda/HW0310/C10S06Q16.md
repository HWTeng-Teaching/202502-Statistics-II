# Question

# Solution

Step 1: $H_0: \frac{\sigma_{1}^2}{\sigma_{2}^2} = 1, H_{a}: \frac{\sigma_{1}^2}{\sigma_{2}^2} \neq 1$  

Step 2: We set the $\alpha = 0.05$

Step 3: $F_{\text{stat}} = \frac{S_{1}^2}{S_{2}^2} \sim F_{n_1-1,n_2-1}$  

Step 4: $F^{*} = \frac{114^2}{103^2} = 1.225$  

Step 5: We are going to find the p-value, and that is 0.355(I ask ChatGPT tp help me on this...)  

Step 6: Because p-value > $\frac{\alpha}{2} = 0.025$, we don't reject $H_0$.  

In conclution, there isn't a sufficient evidence that the two population variances are different.
