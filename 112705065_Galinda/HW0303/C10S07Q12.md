# Solution  
First, we calculate the difference between them.  
c = -1, -1, -2, 1, -1, -1, 0, -1  
$H_0:\mu_1 - \mu_2 = 0 \quad \quad H_1:\mu_1 - \mu_2 \neq 0$ 
and we can get the $\bar{c} = -0.75, s_{c} \approx 0.886$  

$t_{17} = \frac{\bar{c}-0}{\frac{S_c}{\sqrt{n}}} = \frac{-0.75-0}{0.886/\sqrt{8}} \approx -2.394$  

$t_{7, 0.05} = -2.365$  
because -2.394 < -2.365, we will reject $H_0$.
