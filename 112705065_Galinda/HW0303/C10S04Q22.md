# Solution
## a.
Again, we have to calculate their difference first,  
c = 0.006, -0.018, -0.014, -0.011, -0.004, -0.019  
and we set the  
$H_0:\mu_1 - \mu_2 = 0 \quad \quad H_1:\mu_1 - \mu_2 \neq 0$  
and we can get the $\bar{c} = -0.01, s_{c} \approx 0.0095$  

$t_{5} = \frac{\bar{c}-0}{\frac{S_c}{\sqrt{n}}} = \frac{-0.01-0}{0.0095/\sqrt{6}} \approx -2.5703$  

$t_{5, 0.05} = 2.571$  
because -2.5703 > -2.571, we will not reject $H_0$.  

## b.
We will know the 95% C.I. for $\mu_1 - \mu_2$ is  

$\bar{d} \pm t_{(n-1); \alpha/2} \frac{s_{c}}{\sqrt{n}} =  -0.01 \pm 2.571 \frac{0.0095}{\sqrt{6}}$ 

so it's between(-0.02, 0.0000027)
