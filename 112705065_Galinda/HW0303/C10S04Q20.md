# Solution
First, we calculate the difference between them.  
c = 15, 15, 15, 9, 16, 8, 12, 8, 10, 12, 9, 4, 10, 4, 17, 13, 4, 7, 7, 10  
and we set the  
$H_0:\mu_1 - \mu_2 = 0 \quad \quad H_1:\mu_1 - \mu_2 > 0$  
and we can get the $\bar{c} = 10.25, s_{c} \approx 4.051$  

$t_{19} = \frac{\bar{c}-0}{\frac{S_c}{\sqrt{n}}} = \frac{10.25-0}{4.051/\sqrt{20}} \approx 11.316$  

$t_{19, 0.05} = 1.729$  
because 11.316 > 1.729, we will reject $H_0$.
