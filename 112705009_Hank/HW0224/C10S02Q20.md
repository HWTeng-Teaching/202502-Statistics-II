# Hypothesis Testing: Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF) Comparison

## Hypotheses
$H_0$ : $\mu = 74$  
$H_a$ : $\mu \neq 74$  
$\alpha = 0.05$  

## Given Data
- Sample size: $n = 25$
- Sample mean: $\bar{x} = 69.7$
- Sample standard deviation: $s = 16$
- Population mean (under $H_0$): $\mu_0 = 74$

## Compute Test Statistic
\[
t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{s/ \sqrt{n}} = \frac{69.7-74}{16/\sqrt{25}} \approx -1.344
\]

## Determine Critical Value
Using a t-table, the critical value for $t_{24;0.025}$ is **Â±2.064**.

## Decision
\[
\because -t_{24;0.025} = -2.064 \lt -1.344
\]
\[
\therefore \text{ non-reject } H_0
\]

## Conclusion
There is no sufficient evidence that the CBF for stroke patients is different from that of healthy people.
