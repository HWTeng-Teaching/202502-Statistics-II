 $H_0$ : $\mu = 74$  
 $H_a$ : $\mu \neq 74$  
 $\alpha = 0.05$  
 $n = 25$ 
 $\bar{x} = 69.7$
 $s = 16$
 $\mu_0 = 74$

$t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{s/ \sqrt{n}} = \frac{69.7-74}{16/\sqrt{25}} \approx -1.344$  

Using a t-table, the critical value for $t_{24;0.025}$ is **Â±2.064**.


$\because -t_{24;0.025} = -2.064 \lt -1.344$

$\therefore \text{ non-reject } H_0$

There is no sufficient evidence that the CBF for stroke patients is different from that of healthy people.
