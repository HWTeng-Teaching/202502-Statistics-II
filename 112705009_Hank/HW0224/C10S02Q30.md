## a.
$H_0$ : $\mu = 25$

$H_a$ : $\mu < 25$

$\alpha = 0.05$

$t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{s/ \sqrt{n}} = \frac{20.3 - 25}{5 / \sqrt{21}} \approx -4.308$

$\because -t_{20;0.05} = -1.725 > -4.308$

$\therefore$ reject $H_0$

Sufficient evidence that the true pretreatment mean is less than 25.


## b.
$CI = \bar{x} \pm t_{20;0.025} \times \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$

$= 26.6 \pm 2.086 \times \frac{7.4}{\sqrt{21}}$

$= 26.6 \pm 2.086 \times 1.614$

$= 26.6 \pm 3.366$

$= (23.232, 29.968)$

95% confidence that the true posttreatment mean is within (23.232, 29.968).


## c.
- The pretreatment mean is lower than the posttreatment and follow-up means.
- Self-esteem increased after treatment and remained high during follow-up.
- The standard deviation increased over time, suggesting greater variability in self-esteem scores.
