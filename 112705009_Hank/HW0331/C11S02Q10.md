### Question 10

#### Part (a)

- Null Hypothesis ($H_0$):  $\mu_A = \mu_B = \mu_C$  
- Alternative Hypothesis ($H_a$):  $\exists \mu_i \neq \mu_j, i \neq j$  

From the given ANOVA table, we can see that the p-value is **0.0251**, which is smaller than $\alpha = 0.05$. Thus, we **reject the null hypothesis**.  
Therefore, we conclude that there is sufficient evidence to suggest that **at least one** of the training programs (A, B, or C) results in a significantly different **mean assembly time** compared to the others.

#### Part (b)

Formula:

$$
CI = (\bar{x}_A - \bar{x}_B) \pm t_{\alpha/2, df} \cdot \sqrt{MSE \left( \frac{1}{n_A} + \frac{1}{n_B} \right)}
$$  

Substituting the given values:  

$$
\bar{x}_A = 60.5, \quad \bar{x}_B = 54.667
$$  

$$
n_A = 4, \quad n_B = 3
$$  

$$
MSE = 14.941, \quad t_{0.005, 9} \approx 3.250
$$  

\[
SE = \sqrt{14.941 \left( \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{3} \right)} = \sqrt{14.941 \cdot \frac{7}{12}} \approx \sqrt{8.713} \approx 2.952
\]

\[
CI = (60.5 - 54.667) \pm 3.250 \cdot 2.952 = 5.833 \pm 9.594
\]

\[
\boxed{CI = (-3.761,\ 15.427)}
\]

Since 0 is within the confidence interval, we **do not have enough evidence** (at the 99% level) to conclude a significant difference in mean assembly times between Programs A and B.

#### Part (c)

Formula:

$$
CI = \bar{x}_A \pm t_{\alpha/2, n_A - 1} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{s_A^2}{n_A}}
$$  

Substituting the given values:  

$$
\bar{x}_A = 60.5, \quad s_A^2 = 9.667, \quad n_A = 4, \quad t_{0.005, 3} \approx 5.841
$$  

\[
SE = \sqrt{\frac{9.667}{4}} = \sqrt{2.417} \approx 1.554
\]

\[
CI = 60.5 \pm 5.841 \cdot 1.554 = 60.5 \pm 9.079
\]

\[
\boxed{CI = (51.421,\ 69.579)}
\]

We are 99% confident that the true mean assembly time for Program A lies between **51.42 minutes** and **69.58 minutes**.

#### Part (d)

The ANOVA procedure assumes that the populations from which the samples are drawn are **approximately normal** and have **equal variances**.

- The **variances** of the three groups are relatively close:  
  - A: 9.667  
  - B: 9.333  
  - C: 21.7  
- There are **no extreme outliers**, and sample sizes are small but similar.
- Given the moderate spread and no clear skewness in the small data set, we can **reasonably assume** that the populations are approximately normal.

Therefore, although the sample size is small, the assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variance are **not grossly violated**, and the ANOVA results are likely **valid**.
