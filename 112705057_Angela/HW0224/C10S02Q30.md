## a. Hypothesis Test 
**Null Hypothesis (Ho):**   
μ = 25  

**Alternative Hypothesis (Ha):**  
μ < 25  

### Test Statistics:
$\[ T= \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{S/ \sqrt{n}} = \frac{20.3 - 25}{5/ \sqrt{21}} = -4.308 \]$

### Critical Values:
From the t-table:  

$\[ -t_{20,0.05} = -1.725 \]$

Since:  

[-4.308 < -1.725]

### Conclusion:
$\[\Rightarrow \text{Reject }H_0 \]$
##  

## b. $\[ \mu \text{ 的 95}$ \%  ${UCB} \]$

$\[ U_{UCB} = \bar{X} \pm t_{n-1, 0.025} \cdot \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} \]$

$\[ = 26.6 \pm 2.086 \cdot \frac{7.4}{\sqrt{21}} \]$

$\[ = (23.235, 29.965) \]$  
##  

## c. Conclusion:
- There is a noticeable increase in the mean from pretreatment (20.3) to posttreatment (26.6), suggesting that the treatment had a positive effect.
- The mean remains relatively stable from posttreatment (26.6) to follow-up (27.7), indicating that the effect of the treatment may have been sustained over time.
- Since the standard deviations are relatively small (5.0, 7.4, and 8.2, respectively), the differences in means are likely meaningful.
