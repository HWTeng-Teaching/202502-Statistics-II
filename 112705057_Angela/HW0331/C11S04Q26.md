## a. 

- **Treatments**: Mixtures  
  The mixtures (1, 2, and 3) are the different conditions being tested for their effect on propellant thrust. Each mixture represents a treatment level in the experiment.

- **Blocks**: Investigators  
  Each of the five investigators measured the thrust for all three mixtures. Since each investigator tested every mixture, they serve as blocks in a randomized block design. This helps control for variability due to individual investigator differences.



$$
CM = \frac{648^2}{15} = 27993.6
$$

---


$$
TSS = 28316 - 27993.6 = 322.4
$$

---

$$
SST = \left( \frac{202^2}{5} + \frac{212^2}{5} + \frac{234^2}{5} \right) - 27993.6 = 107.2
$$

---


$$
SSB = \left( \frac{126^2}{3} + \frac{113^2}{3} + 44^2 + 48^2 + 128^2 \right) - 27993.6 = 176.4
$$

---


$$
SSE = 322.4 - 107.2 - 176.4 = 38.8
$$



### ANOVA Table

| Source     | df  | SS     | MS     | F                           |
|------------|-----|--------|--------|------------------------------|
| Treatment  | 2   | 107.2  | 53.6   | $$\( F_1 = \frac{53.6}{4.85} \approx 11.05 \)$$ |
| Block      | 4   | 176.4  | 44.1   | $$\( F_2 = \frac{44.1}{4.85} \approx 9.09 \)$$  |
| Error      | 8   | 38.8   | 4.85   |                              |
| Total      | 14  | 322.4  |        |                              |

### b. Is there a significant difference between mixtures? (α = 0.01)

Look up critical value:

- $$\( F_{2,8,0.01} = 8.65 \)$$

Since:

$$
F_{\text{treatment}} = 11.05 > 8.65 \Rightarrow \text{Reject } H_0
$$

**Conclusion**: There is sufficient evidence to conclude that there are significant differences in propellant thrust among the mixtures.

---

### c. Was blocking effective?

Look up critical value:

- $$\( F_{4,8,0.01} = 7.01 \)$$

Since:

$$
F_{\text{block}} = 9.09 > 7.01 \Rightarrow \text{Reject } H_0
$$

**Conclusion**: Blocking (investigators) was effective. There are significant differences between investigators.

### d. Tukey's HSD Test (α = 0.01)

From Studentized Range Table:

- $$\( q_{0.01}(3, 8) \approx 5.04 \)$$

Calculate HSD:

$$
HSD = q \cdot \sqrt{\frac{MSE}{n}} = 5.04 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{4.85}{5}} \approx 5.04 \cdot 0.985 = 4.965
$$

Group Means:

- Mixture 1: $$\( \bar{x}_1 = \frac{202}{5} = 40.4 \)$$
- Mixture 2: $$\( \bar{x}_2 = \frac{212}{5} = 42.4 \)$$
- Mixture 3: $$\( \bar{x}_3 = \frac{234}{5} = 46.8 \)$$

---

### Pairwise Comparisons

| Comparison   | Difference | > HSD (4.965)? | Significant?       |
|--------------|------------|----------------|---------------------|
| M1 vs M2     | 2.0        | No             | Not Significant     |
| M1 vs M3     | 6.4        | Yes            | **Significant**     |
| M2 vs M3     | 4.4        | No             | Not Significant     |

---

### Final Conclusion

- **Significant difference exists between Mixture 1 and Mixture 3**  
- **No significant difference between Mixture 1 and 2 or Mixture 2 and 3**  
- **Blocking was effective** (investigators differ significantly)
