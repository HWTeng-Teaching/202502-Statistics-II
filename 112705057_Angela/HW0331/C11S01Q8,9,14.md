To determine if the data are normally distributed, we’d consider:
* Sample size: The sample on each day includes 100 items, which is relatively large.
* Type of data: The data is proportion data (bounded between 0 and 1).
* Possible issues: If the true proportion of defectives is very low or very high (close to 0 or 1), the distribution could be skewed, not normal.
Conclusion:
You might not be willing to assume normality unless the true proportion of defectives is moderate (not too close to 0 or 1). Normal approximation is more reasonable when np and n(1−p) are both at least 10.
