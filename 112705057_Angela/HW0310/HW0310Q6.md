## Estimating Significance Level When Using Rule of Thumb for Variance Equality

### Problem:
When using the **rule of thumb** to check if two variances are equal, what is the approximate **significance level (α)** when sample sizes are $\( n_1 = 4 \)$ and $\( n_2 = 3 \)$?

### Explanation:

$\[
F = \frac{s_{\text{larger}}^2}{s_{\text{smaller}}^2}
\]$
and declare variances unequal if F > 3. This corresponds to a critical value from the **F-distribution**, and therefore implies a certain **significance level (α)**.

### F-distribution Critical Values (approximate):

| α (right-tail) | \( F_{3,2,\alpha} \) |
|----------------|----------------------|
| 0.10           | ~8.0                 |
| 0.05           | ~19.2                |
| 0.01           | ~99.0                |

This shows that:
- If we use a rule like "F > 2" to claim unequal variances, **the actual α is very high (possibly > 0.3 or 0.4)**.
- That means the **probability of Type I error is large** under such a rule.

### Conclusion:
When \( n_1 = 4 \), \( n_2 = 3 \), and a simple rule-of-thumb F > 2 is applied, the **approximate significance level α is likely between 0.3 and 0.5**, which is a **very loose test**.
