  ##a. 
  Three procedures that can be used are:
 1. Paired t-test
 2. Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test
 3. Sign Test

Assumptions:
 * Paired t-test assumes the differences between paired observations are normally distributed. It is sensitive to violations of this assumption.
 * Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test assumes the differences are symmetrically distributed. It is more robust than the t-test.
 * Sign Test does not assume normality or symmetry, making it the most robust but least powerful.

Do the data meet the assumptions?
Since the sample size is 20 and most differences are large and positive, the distribution may not be normal. Therefore, the nonparametric methods (Wilcoxon and Sign Test) are more appropriate for these data.

b. Sign Test
	•	⊕ = 20
	•	⊖ = 0
	•		•	= 20
	•	n = 20

P(X = 20) = \binom{20}{20} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{20} = 2 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{20} = 0.0000019

Since p-value is very close to 0
⇒ Reject H_0
