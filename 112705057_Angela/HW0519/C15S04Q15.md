  ## a. 
  Three procedures that can be used are:
 1. Paired t-test
 2. Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test
 3. Sign Test

Assumptions:
 * Paired t-test assumes the differences between paired observations are normally distributed. It is sensitive to violations of this assumption.
 * Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test assumes the differences are symmetrically distributed. It is more robust than the t-test.
 * Sign Test does not assume normality or symmetry, making it the most robust but least powerful.

Do the data meet the assumptions?
Since the sample size is 20 and most differences are large and positive, the distribution may not be normal. Therefore, the nonparametric methods (Wilcoxon and Sign Test) are more appropriate for these data.  

  
## b. Sign Test

- ⊕ = 20  
- ⊖ = 0  
- n = 20

$\[
P(X = 20) = \binom{20}{20} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{20} = 2 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{20} = 0.0000019
\]$

Since p-value is very close to 0  
⇒ **Reject H₀**

## Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test

- $\( T^+ = 210 \)$  
- $\( T^- = 0 \)$  
- $\( T = \min(T^+, T^-) = 0 \)$

查表（n = 20, α = 0.01）：  
Rejection Region: $\( T \leq 52 \)$

Since $\( 0 \leq 52 \)$  
⇒ **Reject H₀**

**Yes, the conclusions are the same.**
However, the Wilcoxon test is more powerful because it takes into account both the magnitude and direction of the differences, while the Sign Test only considers direction (+/–).
So although both give the same conclusion, Wilcoxon provides stronger evidence.
