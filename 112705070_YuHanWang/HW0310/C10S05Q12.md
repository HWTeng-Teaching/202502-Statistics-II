## a
- mean number of completions:22.5
- standard deviation of completions:4.70
- mean yards per pass:12.99
- standard deviation of yards per pass:2.53

## b
### 95% confidence interval for the variance of completions
- sample variance of completions:22.13
- degrees of freedom:16
- lower bound:
$\ \frac{15\times22.13}{26.296} = 12.08 \$

- upper bond:
$\ \frac{15\times22.13}{6.262} = 53.02 \$

$\ \Rightarrow (12.08,53.02) \$

A small variability in the number of completed passes is desirable because it means the quarterback's performance is consistent across games. High variability would indicate inconsistency, where the quarterback may have great performances in some games but poor ones in others. In football, consistency is important for reliable offensive performance and game planning.

## c
### 95% C.I. for yards per pass variance
$\ (\frac{(n-1)s^2}{X^2_{upper}},\frac{(n-1)s^2}{X^2_{lower}}) \$

$\ \rightarrow (3.50,15.34) \$

standard deviation:

$\ \sigma = (\sqrt{CI_{lower}},\sqrt{CI_{upper}}) = (\sqrt{3.50},\sqrt{15.34}) = (1.87,3.92)\$

## d
- Null Hypothesis
$\ (H_0):\sigma = 4 \$

- Alternative Hypothesis
$\ (H_a):\sigma\neq 4 \$

- Test statistics = -6.72

- p-value
$\ \approx 9.76\times 10^{-6} \$

$\ \Rightarrow \$
Since the p-value is very small (less than 0.05), we reject the null hypothesis. This indicates that the standard deviation of yards per pass for this quarterback significantly differs from 4 yards.
