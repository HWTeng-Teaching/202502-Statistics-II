## Hypothesis

Null Hypothesis:
$\ H_0 : \mu = 100 \$

Alternative Hypothesis:
$\ H_a : \mu < 100 \$

## Test Statistic

$\ t = \frac{\bar{x}-\mu_0}{s/\sqrt{n}} \$
where
$\ \mu_0 = 100 \$

## Solve (a)

Using a one-tailed test at 
$\alpha = 0.1\$
,find the critical t-value from a t-table.

Compare the calculated t-value with the critical t-value:

If 𝑡 is less than the critical value, reject 
$\ H_0 \$
​

Otherwise, fail to reject 
$\ H_0 \$
​
## (b)confidence interval

Find a 99% one-sided confidence bound

If the confidence bound does not contain 100, this confirms the conclusion from part (a).
 .

 ## (c)

Null hypothesis : All three population means are equal.

Alternative hypothesis : At least one of the means is different.

If the p-value is less than α (e.g., 0.05), we reject 
$\ H_0 \$
​ , indicating that at least one of the groups has a significantly different mean.
