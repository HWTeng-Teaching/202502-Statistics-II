# Hypothesis
**Null Hypothesis (H₀):μ = 22**  
**Alternative Hypothesis (Ha):μ > 22** 

## Test statistics
t-statistic for a one-sample t-test is given by:

$\ T= \frac{\bar{x}- \mu_0}{s/\sqrt{n}} \$

substitute the values:

$\ T=\frac{31-22}{6.2/\sqrt{17}} \$   

The computed t-statistic is **5.985**

### Critical Value
the critical value at 
$\\alpha = 0.05 \$ 
and
$\\mathit{df} = 16 \$
is **1.746**

### Compare t-statistic with critical value
5.985>1.746, so we reject the null hypothesis.

### Conclusion for part a
At the 5% significance level, the data provides strong evidence that injected rats drink more water than non-injected rats.

### 90% C.I.

$\ \bar{x} \pm t_{\frac{\alpha}{2},df} \times \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} \$

so, the 90% confidence interval for the mean water intake of injected rats is (28.37 cm³, 33.63 cm³).
