## a
the randomized block design is used in collecting these data.
blocks: five children, treatments:four antibiotics

## b
The normal distribution assumption is satisfied, but the common variance assumption is not satisfied.

## c
$\ T_1=12 \$  
$\ T_2 = 13 \$
$\ T_3 = 10 \$
$\ T_4 =15 \$

$\ b=5 ,k=4 \$

$\ H_0: \$
The 4 distributions are identical.

$\ H_a: \$
at least one distribution is different

$\ F^{*}_r = \frac{12}{5 \times 4 \times 5} \sum(12^2+13^2+10^2+15^2)-3 \times 5 \times 5 = 1.56 \$

$\ X^2_{0.05,3} = 7.81473 \$

$\ \because 1.56 < 7.81473 \$

 $\ \therefore \$
 non-reject
 $\ H_0 \$

 $\ \Rightarrow \$
 there is no siginificant difference in the distributions of responses to the tastes of the four antibiotics.
