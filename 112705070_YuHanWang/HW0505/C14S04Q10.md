$\ E_{11}=E_{12}=E_{13} = \frac{498 \times 300}{900} =166 \$

$\ E_{21} = E_{22} = E_{23} = \frac{403 \times 300} {900} = 134 \$

$\ H_o: \$
marriage rate is independent of educational level.

$\ H_a: \$
marriage rate depends on educational level.

$\ X^2 = \frac{(187-166)^2}{166}+\frac{(162-166)^2}{166}+...+\frac{(151-134)^2}{134} = 10.0611 \$

$\ X^2_{2,0.01} = 9.21034 \$

$\ \because 10.0611>9.21034 \$

$\ \therefore \$
reject
$\ H_0 \$

there is a siginificant differences amoing adults in these educational level.
