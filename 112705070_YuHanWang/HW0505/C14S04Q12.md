$\ E_{11} = E_{12} = E_{13} = \frac{29 \times 40}{120} = 9.6667 \$

$\ E_{21} = E_{22} = E_{23} = \frac{33 \times 40}{120} = 11 \$

$\ E_{31} = E_{32} = E_{33} = \frac{34 \times 40}{120} = 11.3333 \$

$\ E_{41} = E_{42} = E_{43} = \frac{24 \times 40}{120} = 8 \$

$\ H_0 \$
: family size is independent of types of residence.

$\ H_a \$
: family size depends on types of residence.

$\ X^2=\frac{(8-9.6667)^2}{9.6667}+\frac{(20-9.6667)^2}{9.6667}+...+\frac{(16-8)^2}{8} = 36.4991 \$

$\ X^2_{6,0.01} = 16.8119 \$

$\ \because 36.4991>16.8119 \$

$\ \therefore \$
reject
$\ H_0 \$

$\ \Rightarrow \$
there is siginificnt difference in the family size distributions for the three types of residence.

the nature of these differences:

single-member households are strongly concentrated in duplexes 

two-member households are more common in apartments

three-member families are evenly distributed in residence types

four or more members prefer single residence.
