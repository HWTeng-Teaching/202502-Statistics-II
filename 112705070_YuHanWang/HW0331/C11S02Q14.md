## Formulate Hypotheses

Null Hypothesis $\(H_0)\$: There is no difference in the average prices among the four categories.

Alternative Hypothesis $\(H_a)\$: At least one category has a different average price.

## Calculate the Mean and Variance

Mean for Light Tuna in Water: 
$$\bar{X}_{LW} = 1.49$$

Mean for White Tuna in Water: 
$$\bar{X}_{WW} = 2.29$$

Mean for White Tuna in Oil: 
$$\bar{X}_{WO} = 2.59$$

Mean for Light Tuna in Oil: 
$$\bar{X}_{LO} = 1.99$$

Overall Mean: 
$$\bar{X} = \frac{1.49 + 2.29 + 2.59 + 1.99}{4} = 2.09$$

## Calculate Sum of Squares

Sum of Squares Between (SSB): Measures the variance between the groups.
$$SSB = \sum_{i=1}^{k} n_i (\bar{X}_i - \bar{X})^2 = (1.49 - 2.09)^2 + (2.29 - 2.09)^2 + (2.59 - 2.09)^2 + (1.99 - 2.09)^2 = 0.66$$

Sum of Squares Within (SSW): Measures the variance within the groups.
$$SSW = 0$$

Total Sum of Squares (SST): 
$$SST = SSB + SSW = 0.66 + 0 = 0.66$$

## Degrees of Freedom

Degrees of Freedom Between (df_between): 
$$k - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3$$

Degrees of Freedom Within (df_within): 
$$N - k = 4 - 4 = 0$$

## Mean Squares

Mean Square Between (MSB): 
$$MSB = \frac{SSB}{df_{between}} = \frac{0.66}{3} = 0.22$$

Mean Square Within (MSW): 
$$MSW = \frac{SSW}{df_{within}} = \frac{0}{0} = \text{undefined}$$

## F-ratio

$$F = \frac{MSB}{MSW} = \text{undefined}$$

## Decision

p-value from the F-distribution: 
$$p = \text{undefined}$$
Since the degrees of freedom within is zero, the F-ratio and p-value are undefined.

## Conclusion

There is no evidence of a significant difference in average price for these packages at the α = .05 level of significance or at the α = .01 level of significance.

## Confidence Intervals

- **95% Confidence Interval for the difference in price between light tuna in water and light tuna in oil**:
  $$\left(\text{undefined}, \text{undefined}\right)$$

- **99% Confidence Interval for the difference in price between white tuna in water and white tuna in oil**:
  $$\left(\text{undefined}, \text{undefined}\right)$$
