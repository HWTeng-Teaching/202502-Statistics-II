## Formulate Hypotheses

Null Hypothesis $\(H_0)\$: There is no difference in the mean assembly times among the three training programs.

Alternative Hypothesis $\(H_a)\$: At least one training program has a different mean assembly time.

## Calculate the Mean and Variance

Mean for Program A: 
$$\bar{X}_A = \frac{5 + 5 + 5 + 7}{4} = 5.5$$

Mean for Program B: 
$$\bar{X}_B = \frac{9 + 9 + 9 + 15}{4} = 10.5$$

Mean for Program C: 
$$\bar{X}_C = \frac{8 + 8 + 8 + 8}{4} = 8$$

Overall Mean: 
$$\bar{X} = \frac{5 + 5 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 15 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8}{12} = 7.75$$

## Calculate Sum of Squares

Sum of Squares Between (SSB): Measures the variance between the groups.
$$SSB = \sum_{i=1}^{k} n_i (\bar{X}_i - \bar{X})^2 = 4(5.5 - 7.75)^2 + 4(10.5 - 7.75)^2 + 4(8 - 7.75)^2 = 50$$

Sum of Squares Within (SSW): Measures the variance within the groups.
$$SSW = \sum_{i=1}^{k} \sum_{j=1}^{n_i} (X_{ij} - \bar{X}_i)^2 = (5-5.5)^2 + (5-5.5)^2 + (5-5.5)^2 + (7-5.5)^2 + (9-10.5)^2 + (9-10.5)^2 + (9-10.5)^2 + (15-10.5)^2 + (8-8)^2 + (8-8)^2 + (8-8)^2 + (8-8)^2 = 30$$

Total Sum of Squares (SST): 
$$SST = SSB + SSW = 50 + 30 = 80$$

## Degrees of Freedom

Degrees of Freedom Between (df_between): 
$$k - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2$$

Degrees of Freedom Within (df_within): 
$$N - k = 12 - 3 = 9$$

## Mean Squares

Mean Square Between (MSB): 
$$MSB = \frac{SSB}{df_{between}} = \frac{50}{2} = 25$$

Mean Square Within (MSW): 
$$MSW = \frac{SSW}{df_{within}} = \frac{30}{9} = 3.33$$

## F-ratio

$$F = \frac{MSB}{MSW} = \frac{25}{3.33} = 7.5$$

## Decision

p-value from the F-distribution: 
$$p = 0.0121$$

Since \(p < 0.05\), we reject the null hypothesis \(H_0\).

## Conclusion

The data indicate a significant difference in mean assembly times for people trained by the three programs.

## Confidence Intervals

- **99% Confidence Interval for Between-Group Variance**:
  $$\left(4.72, 4987.49\right)$$

- **99% Confidence Interval for Within-Group Variance**:
  $$\left(1.27, 17.29\right)$$

## Normality Check

Using the Shapiro-Wilk test for normality:

- Program A: \(W = 0.63\), \(p = 0.0012\)
- Program B: \(W = 0.63\), \(p = 0.0012\)
- Program C: \(W = 1.0\), \(p = 1.0\)

There is evidence that variability is not approximately normally distributed.
