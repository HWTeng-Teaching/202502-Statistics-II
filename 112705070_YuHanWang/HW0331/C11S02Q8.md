## Formulate Hypotheses

Null Hypothesis (\(H_0\)): There is no difference in the mean scores among the three methods.

Alternative Hypothesis (\(H_1\)): At least one method has a different mean score.

## Calculate the Mean and Variance

Mean for Method A: 
$$\bar{X}_A = \frac{73 + 74 + 76 + 68 + 80}{5} = 74.2$$

Mean for Method B: 
$$\bar{X}_B = \frac{79 + 85 + 87}{3} = 83.67$$

Mean for Method C: 
$$\bar{X}_C = \frac{74 + 75 + 78}{3} = 75.67$$

Overall Mean: 
$$\bar{X} = \frac{73 + 74 + 76 + 68 + 80 + 79 + 85 + 87 + 74 + 75 + 78}{11} = 77.36$$

## Calculate Sum of Squares

Sum of Squares Between (SSB): Measures the variance between the groups.
$$SSB = \sum_{i=1}^{k} n_i (\bar{X}_i - \bar{X})^2 = 5(74.2 - 77.36)^2 + 3(83.67 - 77.36)^2 + 3(75.67 - 77.36)^2 = 177.50$$

Sum of Squares Within (SSW): Measures the variance within the groups.
$$SSW = \sum_{i=1}^{k} \sum_{j=1}^{n_i} (X_{ij} - \bar{X}_i)^2 = (73-74.2)^2 + (74-74.2)^2 + (76-74.2)^2 + (68-74.2)^2 + (80-74.2)^2 + (79-83.67)^2 + (85-83.67)^2 + (87-83.67)^2 + (74-75.67)^2 + (75-75.67)^2 + (78-75.67)^2 = 120.13$$

Total Sum of Squares (SST): 
$$SST = SSB + SSW = 177.50 + 120.13 = 297.63$$

## Degrees of Freedom

Degrees of Freedom Between (df_between): 
$$k - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2$$

Degrees of Freedom Within (df_within): 
$$N - k = 11 - 3 = 8$$

## Mean Squares

Mean Square Between (MSB): 
$$MSB = \frac{SSB}{df_{between}} = \frac{177.50}{2} = 88.75$$
Mean Square Within (MSW): 
$$MSW = \frac{SSW}{df_{within}} = \frac{120.13}{8} = 15.02$$

## F-ratio

$$F = \frac{MSB}{MSW} = \frac{88.75}{15.02} = 5.91$$

## Decision

p-value from the F-distribution: 
$$p = 0.0265$$

Since \(p < 0.05\), we reject the null hypothesis $\(H_0\$).

## Conclusion

The data provide sufficient evidence to indicate a difference in mean student scores after treatment for the three methods.
