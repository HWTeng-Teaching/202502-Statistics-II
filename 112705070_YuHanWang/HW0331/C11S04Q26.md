## Solution

### a. Identify the treatments and the blocks in this experiment and provide an appropriate analysis of variance.

- **Treatments**: The three mixtures (Mixture 1, Mixture 2, Mixture 3).
- **Blocks**: The five investigators (Investigator 1, Investigator 2, Investigator 3, Investigator 4, Investigator 5).

### b. Is there sufficient evidence to conclude that there is a significant difference in the propellant thrust for the mixtures? Use \( \alpha = 0.01 \).

To determine if there is a significant difference in the propellant thrust for the mixtures, we perform an ANOVA test.

#### Formulate Hypotheses:

Null Hypothesis $\(H_0)\$: There is no difference in the mean propellant thrust among the three mixtures.

Alternative Hypothesis $\(H_a)\$: At least one mixture has a different mean propellant thrust.

#### ANOVA Table:

$$
\begin{array}{|l|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\text{Source of Variation} & \text{Sum of Squares (SS)} & \text{Degrees of Freedom (df)} & \text{Mean Square (MS)} & F \\
\hline
\text{Between Groups (Mixtures)} & 52.93 & 2 & 26.47 & 16.20 \\
\text{Within Groups (Investigators)} & 5.73 & 4 & 1.43 & 0.88 \\
\text{Residual} & 13.07 & 8 & 1.63 & \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

- **F-ratio for Mixtures**: $\( F = 16.20 )\$
- **p-value for Mixtures**: $\( p = 0.0015 )\$

Since $\( p < 0.01 )\$, we reject the null hypothesis $\(H_0\$). Therefore, there is sufficient evidence to conclude that there is a significant difference in the propellant thrust for the mixtures.

### c. Was blocking effective? Use the p-value to draw your conclusions and justify your answer.

To determine if blocking was effective, we look at the ANOVA table for investigators.

- **F-ratio for Investigators**: $\( F = 0.88 \$)
- **p-value for Investigators**: $\( p = 0.518 \$)

Since $\( p > 0.01 \$), we do not reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, blocking was not effective, meaning that the differences in propellant thrust measurements among the investigators are not significant.

### d. Use Tukeyâ€™s pairwise comparisons with $\( \alpha = 0.01 \$) to determine which propellant mixtures differed from others.

#### Tukey's HSD Test Results:

$$
\begin{array}{|l|l|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\text{Group 1} & \text{Group 2} & \text{Mean Difference} & \text{p-value} & \text{Lower Bound} & \text{Upper Bound} & \text{Significant} \\
\hline
\text{Mixture 1} & \text{Mixture 2} & -4.6 & 0.0002 & -7.42 & -1.78 & \text{Yes} \\
\text{Mixture 1} & \text{Mixture 3} & -2.2 & 0.0411 & -5.02 & 0.62 & \text{No} \\
\text{Mixture 2} & \text{Mixture 3} & 2.4 & 0.0262 & -0.42 & 5.22 & \text{No} \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

### Conclusion:

- There is a significant difference in the mean propellant thrust between Mixture 1 and Mixture 2.
- There is no significant difference in the mean propellant thrust between Mixture 1 and Mixture 3.
- There is no significant difference in the mean propellant thrust between Mixture 2 and Mixture 3.
