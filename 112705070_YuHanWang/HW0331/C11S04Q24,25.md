## Solution

### a. What are the blocks and treatments in this experiment?

- **Blocks**: The items (Raisin Bran, Skippy Peanut Butter, Kraft Macaroni & Cheese, Kellogg’s Corn Flakes, Gold Medal Flour, Campbell’s Soup, Crest Toothpaste).
- **Treatments**: The grocery stores (Vons, Ralphs, Stater Bros, WinCo).

### b. Does there provide evidence to indicate that there are significant differences in prices from store to store? Specifically state which ANOVA assumptions must be checked.

To determine if there are significant differences in prices from store to store, we perform an ANOVA test.

#### Formulate Hypotheses:

Null Hypothesis $\(H_0)\$: There is no difference in the mean prices among the four stores.

Alternative Hypothesis $\(H_a)\$: At least one store has a different mean price.

#### ANOVA Table:

$$
\begin{array}{lccc}
\text{Source} & \text{SS} & \text{df} & \text{MS} & F \\
\hline
\text{Between Groups (Stores)} & 6.89 & 3 & 2.30 & 15.85 \\
\text{Within Groups (Items)} & 51.53 & 6 & 8.59 & 59.32 \\
\text{Residual} & 2.61 & 18 & 0.14 & \\
\end{array}
$$

- **F-ratio for Stores**: $\( F = 15.85 )\$
- **p-value for Stores**: $\( p = 2.71 \times 10^{-5} )\$

Since $\( p < 0.05 )\$, we reject the null hypothesis $\(H_0)\$. Therefore, there is sufficient evidence to indicate significant differences in prices from store to store.

#### ANOVA Assumptions:

- **Independence of observations**: Assumed in the design.
- **Normality of residuals**: Checked using the Shapiro-Wilk test.
  $\[
  \text{Shapiro-Wilk Test for Normality of Residuals: } W = 0.98, p = 0.77
  ]\$
  Since $\( p > 0.05 )\$, we do not reject the null hypothesis of normality.
- **Homogeneity of variances**: Checked using Levene's test.
  $\[
  \text{Levene's Test for Homogeneity of Variances: } F = 0.33, p = 0.81
  ]\$
  Since $\( p > 0.05 )\$, we do not reject the null hypothesis of equal variances.

### c. Are there significant differences from block to block? What does this mean?

To determine if there are significant differences from block to block (items), we look at the ANOVA table for items.

- **F-ratio for Items**: $\( F = 59.32 )\$
- **p-value for Items**: $\( p = 6.99 \times 10^{-11} )\$

Since $\( p < 0.05 )\$, we reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, there are significant differences in prices from block to block, meaning that the prices of different items vary significantly.

### Summary of Means:

- **Store Means**:
  
$$
\begin{array}{lcc}
\text{Store} & \text{Mean Price} \\
\hline
\text{Ralphs} & 3.82 \\
\text{Stater Bros} & 3.22 \\
\text{Vons} & 3.82 \\
\text{WinCo} & 2.62 \\
\end{array}
$$

- **Item Means**:
  
- Campbell’s Soup, Chicken Noodle: 1.81
  - Crest Toothpaste: 2.31
  - Gold Medal Flour, all-purpose: 2.61
  - Kellogg’s Corn Flakes, family size (24 oz) box: 3.61
  - Kraft Macaroni & Cheese, box of five packets (7 oz each): 5.49
  - Raisin Bran, 36-oz box: 5.24
  - Skippy Peanut Butter, 16-oz jar: 2.51
