## a
correlation analysis, because two variables are measured on each individual.

## b

$\ r= \frac{S_{xy}}{\sqrt{S_{xx}S_{yy}}} = \frac{56140 - \frac{155 \times 2490}{7}}{\sqrt{3541 - \frac{155^2}{7} \times 896700 - \frac{2490^2}{7}}} = 0.91896 \$

$\ t = r \times \sqrt{\frac{n-2}{1-r^2}}  = 0.91896 \times \sqrt{\frac{5}{1-0.91896}} = 5.2122\$

$\ t_{5,0.025} = 2.571 \$

sincs 5.2122 >2.571, we reject
$\ H_0 \$

$\ \Rightarrow \$
there is no enough evidence to say that there is correlation between x and y.
