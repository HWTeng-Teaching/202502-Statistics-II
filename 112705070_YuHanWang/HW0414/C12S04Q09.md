## a
only 2.7% of the variation is explained, shich shows a weak relationship.

## b
In the normal probability plot, the residuals donâ€™t closely follow the straight line, this suggests the normality assumption may be violated. 
In the residuals versus fitted value plot, there is non-constant spread of residuals,which indicates violation of equal variance assumption.
## c

the relationship doesn't appear linear.
