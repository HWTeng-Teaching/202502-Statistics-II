## a
-  the independent variable x and the dependent variable y is linear.
-  the random error
  $\ \epsilon \$
are indenpendent.
-  the randon errors have mean =0, and a constant varinace
  $\ \sigma^2 \$
-  the random errors should be normally distributed.

## b
$\ \sigma^2 = 58.05 \$

## c
in the normal probability plot, there are deviations in the tails, so the residuals are showing non-normality.
in tne residuals versus fits plot, the points do not scatter randomly around y=0, so it doesn't match the assimption.
