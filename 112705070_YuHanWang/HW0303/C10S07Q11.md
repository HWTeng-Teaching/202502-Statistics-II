## Hypothesis

- Null hypothesis
$\ (H_0):\mu_d = 0 \$

- Alternative hypothesis
$\ (H_a):\mu_d \neq0 \$

## Data
- Sample mean of differences:
$\ \bar{d} = \frac{\sum{d_i}}{n} = -1.0625 \$

- Standard deviation of differences:
$\ s_d = \sqrt{\frac{\sum{(d_i-\bar{d})^2}}{n-1}} = \sqrt{\frac{57}{15}} = 1.95 \$

- t = 
$\ \frac{\bar{d}}{s_d/\sqrt{n}} = \frac{-1.0625}{1.95/\sqrt{16}} = -3.46 \$

- p-value = 0.00347

$\ \Rightarrow \$
Since p<0.05, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference between the reaction times for the two stimuli.
