## a.

$\ {s_1}^{2} = 2.78095 , {s_2}^{2} = 0.17143 \$

$\ \frac{{s_1}^{2}}{{s_2}^{2}} = 16.22 \$

$\ \Rightarrow \$
since 16.22 is much larger than the typical critical value , we reject the assumption of equal variances.


## b.

$\ t=\frac{\bar{x_1}-\bar{x_2}}{\sqrt{\frac{{s_1}^{2}}{n_1}+\frac{{s_2}^{2}}{n_2}}} = \frac{3.73 - 4.80}{\sqrt{\frac{2.78095}{15}+\frac{0.17143}{15}}} = -2.41 \$

df = 15.72

the critical value for a two-tailed test at 
$\ \alpha = 0.05 \$
and 15.72 degrees of freedom is 
$\ \pm 2.12 \$

$\ \rightarrow \$
since -2.41 is beyond -2.12 , we 
**reject the null hypothesis.**

$\ \Rightarrow \$
There is
**significant evidence**
that the mean number differs between 95% ethanol and 20% bleach.
