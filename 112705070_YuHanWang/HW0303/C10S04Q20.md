## Hypothesis

Null hypothesis
$\ (H_0):\mu = 0 \$

Alternative hypothesis
$\ (H_a):\mu > 0 \$

## solve

- t-statistic:
$\ t= \frac{\bar{d}}{{\frac{s_d}{\sqrt{n}}}} = \frac{10.25}{\frac{4.04}{\sqrt{20}}} = 11.32 \$
- p-value =
$\ 3.47 \times 10^{-10} \$

- 95% confidence level:
$\ CI = \bar{d}\pm t_{\alpha/2}\times \frac{s_d}{\sqrt{n}} = 10.25\pm (2.093\times0.904)\$

$\ \rightarrow (8.35,12.15) \$

$\ \Rightarrow \$
Since the p-value is extremely small and the confidence interval does not include 0, the recall is significantly higher with imagery.
