## Hypothesis

- Null hypothesis:
$\ (H_0):\mu_d = 0 \$

- Alternative hypothesis:
$\ (H_a):\mu_d \neq0 \$

## Data

- mean difference:
$\ \bar{d} = -0.75 \$

- standard deviation of difference:
$\ s_d = 0.886 \$

## Solve

$\ t= \frac{\bar{d}}{s_d/\sqrt{n}} = \frac{-0.75}{0.886/\sqrt{8}} = -2.393 \$

p-value = 0.0479

$\ \Rightarrow \$
Since p=0.0479<0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. This suggests that there is sufficient evidence to conclude that there is a significant difference in mean reaction times between the two stimuli.
