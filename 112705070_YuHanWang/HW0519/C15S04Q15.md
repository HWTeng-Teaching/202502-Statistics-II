## a
three testing procedures:
-  paired y-test
-  wilcoxon signed-rank test
-  sign test

Assumption for paired t-test:
-  the differences between pairs are normally distributed
-  the observations are paired and independent
-  the data is measured on at lease on interval scale.

Checking assumptions:
-  the differences appear to be mostly positive
-  there are some extreme difference

$\Rightarrow$ The data doesn't fullt satisfy the assumption.

## b
sign test:
$\ T^+=20,T^-=0 \$

$\ 2P(X\leq 0) \approx 0<0.05 \$

$\therefore$ reject $H_0$


sign-rank test:
$\ T^+=210,T^-=0 \$

$\ min(T^+,T^-)=min(210,0)=0 \$

$\ T_0=52>0 \$

$\therefore$ reject $H_0$

## c
both test get the same conclusion
