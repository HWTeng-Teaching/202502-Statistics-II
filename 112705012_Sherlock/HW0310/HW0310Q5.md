# Question 22

## Question (a)

$H_0: \sigma_1^2 = \sigma_2^2$  
$H_a: \sigma_1^2 \neq \sigma_2^2$  

set $\alpha$ = 0.05  

$F_{14,14} = \frac{2.96}{1.54} = 1.92$  

$p-value = 2 \times P(F_{14,14} > 1.92) = 2 \times 0.117295 = 0.235$  

the p-value is larger than $\alpha$, reject $H_0$  

## Question (b)

$(\frac{2.96}{1.54} \times \frac{1}{F{14,14,0.005}}, \frac{2.96}{1.54} \times F_{14,14,0.005}) = (0.45,8.26)$
