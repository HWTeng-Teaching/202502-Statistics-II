## a

- $H_0$: Salary is independent of workdays spent at home.  
- $H_a$: Salary is dependent on workdays spent at home.  

$$
X^2 = \frac{(38-36.27)^2}{36.27 } + \frac{(16-21.08)^2}{21.08} + ... + \frac{(12-11.59)^2}{11.59} = 6.4465
$$

$$
\chi^2_{6, 0.05} = 12.59 > 6.4465
$$

**we fail to reject $H_0$**

## b

p-value: 0.1 < p < 0.9
p > 0.5

**we fail to reject $H_0$**
