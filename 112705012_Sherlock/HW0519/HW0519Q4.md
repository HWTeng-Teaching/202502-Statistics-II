## Question 8

## a

- $H_0$: There is no difference in the median increase in heart rate across the four age groups.
- $H_a$: At least one age group has a different median increase in heart rate compared to the others.

$$
H=\frac{12}{N(N+1)} \sum(\frac{T_i^2}{n_i}) -3(N+1)
$$

$$
H=\frac{12}{N(N+1)} \sum(\frac{T_i^2}{n_i}) -3(N+1) = \frac{12}{40(40+1)} (\frac{263^2}{10}+\frac{210^2}{10}+\frac{228^2}{10}+\frac{239^2}{10})-3(40+1) \approx 39.6
$$

critical value is $X_{3,0.01}^2=11.345$

$H=39.6>X_{3,0.01}^2=11.345$

**We reject $H_0$.**
