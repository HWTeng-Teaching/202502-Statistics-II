# Problem 24

## A

Block: The 8 items.

Treatment: The 4 grocery stores

## B

Hypotheses:  
$H_0$: All stores have the same price.

$H_a$: At least one store’s mean price differs.

- p = 0.000

Since p < 0.05\, we reject $H_0$. There is significant evidence that at least one store’s mean price differs from others. 

## C

 The ANOVA shows a P-value of 0.000 for "Item", meaning that product prices are very different.

 - F-value (35.32) is even larger than the store F-value, showing that product differences are greater than store differences.

 Since product prices vary a lot, using blocking was effective because it helps us compare store prices more accurately.

 # Problem 25

 ## A

 - k = 4
 - df = 21
 - $q_{0.05}(4,21) \approx 3.94$

## B

$$
\omega = q_{0.05}(4, 21) \times \sqrt{\frac{MSE}{b}} = 3.94 \times \sqrt{\frac{0.1658}{8}} = 3.94 \times 0.144 \approx 0.567
$$  

## C

Store Means:  
| Store       | Mean Price |  
|-------------|------------|  
| WinCo       | 2.68125    |  
| Stater Bros | 3.85250    |  
| Vons        | 4.13500    |  
| Ralphs      | 4.34000    |  

Compare Differences to $\omega = 0.567$:  
| Pair                     | Difference | Significant? |  
|--------------------------|------------|--------------|  
| WinCo vs. Ralphs         | 1.65875    | **Yes**      |  
| WinCo vs. Vons           | 1.45375    | **Yes**      |  
| WinCo vs. Stater Bros    | 1.17125    | **Yes**      |  
| Stater Bros vs. Ralphs   | 0.48750    | No           |  
| Stater Bros vs. Vons     | 0.28250    | No           |  
| Vons vs. Ralphs          | 0.20500    | No           |
