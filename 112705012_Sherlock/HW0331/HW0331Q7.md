# Problem 24

## A

Block: The 8 items.

Treatment: The 4 grocery stores

## B

Hypotheses:  
$H_0$: All stores have the same price.

$H_a$: At least one store’s mean price differs.

- p = 0.000

Since p < 0.05\, we reject $H_0$. There is significant evidence that at least one store’s mean price differs from others. 

## C

 The ANOVA shows a P-value of 0.000 for "Item", meaning that product prices are very different.

 -F-value (35.32) is even larger than the store F-value, showing that product differences are greater than store differences.

 Since product prices vary a lot, using blocking was effective because it helps us compare store prices more accurately.
