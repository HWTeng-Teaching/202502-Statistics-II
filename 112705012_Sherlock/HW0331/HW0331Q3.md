# Question 10

## A

- $H_0$:  $\mu_A = \mu_B = \mu_C$
- $H_a$:  $\exists \mu_i \neq \mu_j, i \neq j$

The p-value is 0.0251, smaller than $\alpha = 0.05$. Thus we reject the $H_0$.

We can conclude that there is enough evidence to determine that at least one of the training programs (A, B, or C) leads to a significantly different average assembly time compared to the others.

## B

$$
\bar{x}_A = 60.5, \quad \bar{x}_B = 54.667
$$  

$$
n_A = 4, \quad n_B = 3
$$  

$$
MSE = 14.941, \quad t_{0.005, 9} \approx 3.250
$$  

$$
CI = (\bar{x_A} - \bar{x_B}) \pm t_{\alpha/2, df} \cdot \sqrt{MSE \left( \frac{1}{n_A} + \frac{1}{n_B} \right)} = 5.833 \pm 9.59 = (-3.757,\ 15.423)
$$

## C

$$
\bar{x}_A = 60.5
$$

$$
n_A = 4,\quad df = n_A - 1 = 3
$$

$$
t_{0.005, 3} \approx 5.841\ 
$$

$$
CI = \bar{x_A} \pm t_{\alpha/2, df} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{MSE}{n_A}} = 60.5 \pm 9.08 = (51.42,\ 69.58)
$$

## D

The data seems to reasonably meet the normality assumption for ANOVA because:

- The variance differences remain within acceptable ranges.

- There are no clear signs of strong non-normality in the observed values.

- Although formal tests would be ideal for small samples, the given data does not exhibit any apparent violations.
