## Solution

### a.

A randomized block design was used to collect these data.  
Five children are the building blocks, four antibiotics are the treatments.  
Collecting data in this way made it possible to control for differences between children and observe the effects of antibiotics.

### b.

The usual assumptions for analysis of variance (ANOVA) are as follows:

1.The residuals should be approximately normally distributed.

2.There should be a common variance across all treatment/block combinations (i.e., homogeneity of variances).

Based on the normal probability plot, the points lie very close to the reference line and no outliers are observed, indicating that the residuals are approximately normally distributed.

However, the scatter plot of residuals versus antibiotic type shows that the variance for Antibiotic 1 differs from that of Antibiotic 2. This suggests a potential violation of the assumption of homogeneity of variances.

In summary, while the assumption of normality is satisfied, the assumption of equal variances is not fully met.

### c.

Use Friedman $F_r$ -test,

|rank| T1| T2| T3| T4|
|:--:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| B1 | 2 | 1 | 4 | 3 |
| B2 | 2 | 3 | 1 | 4 |
| B3 | 3 | 1 | 2 | 4 |
| B4 | 2 | 4 | 1 | 3 |
| B5 | 3 | 4 | 2 | 1 |

$T_1 = 12$ 

$T_2 = 13$

$T_3 = 10$

$T_4 = 15$  

$b = 5$

$k=4$  
  
$H_0$: 4 distributions are identical 

$H_a$: at least one distribution is different

$\alpha = 0.05$

Test statistic:

$$
F_{r,STAT} = \frac{12}{bk(k+1)} \sum T_i^2 - 3b(k+1) \sim \chi^2_{(k-1)}
$$

Realized statistic:

$$
F_r^* = \frac{12}{8 * 4\*5} \sum (12^2 + 13^2 + 10^2 + 15^2) - 3\*8\*5 = 1.56
$$

Rejection region: $\\{F_r: F_r > \chi^2_{3;0.05} = 7.81473 \\}$

Since $1.56$ does not fall into the rejection region, we fail to reject $H_0$, which means that there is no significant difference in the distributions of reponses to the tastes of the four antibiotics.
