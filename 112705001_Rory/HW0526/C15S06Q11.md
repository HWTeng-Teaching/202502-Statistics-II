## Solution

### a.

|rank| B1| B2| B3| B4| B5| B6|
|:--:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| T1 | 4 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 |
| T2 | 1 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 |
| T3 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 5 |
| T4 | 3 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 4 |
| T5 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
  
$T_1 = 18 \quad \quad T_2 = 12 \quad \quad T_3 = 26 \quad \quad T_4 = 27 \quad \quad T_5 = 7$

$b = 6 \quad \quad k=5$  
  
$H_0$: 5 distributions are identical

$H_a$: at least one distribution is different

$\alpha = 0.05$

Test statistic:

$$
F_{r,STAT} = \frac{12}{bk(k+1)} \left( \sum_{i=1}^k T_i^2 \right) - 3b(k+1) \sim \chi^2_{(k-1)}
$$

Realized statistic:

$$
F_r^* = \frac{12}{6*5 \*6} (18^2 + 12^2 + 26^2 + 27^2 + 7^2) - 3\*6\*6 = 21.466
$$

Rejection region: $\\{F_r: F_r > \chi^2_{4;0.05} = 9.4877\\}$

Since $21.466$ falls into the rejection region, we reject $H_0$, which means the data provide sufficient evidence to indicate a difference in the yields for the five different varieties of wheat.


### b.

The test statistic from ANOVA F test F = 18.61, and the p-value is close to 0, which also shows that there are significant differences among wheat varieties. In conclusion, the Friedman test confirmed the results of the ANOVA and provided additional confidence in the results showing significant differences in yield among wheat varieties.
