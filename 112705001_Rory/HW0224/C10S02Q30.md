## Solution

### a.

Hypothesis Test:

$$
H_0:μ > 25
$$
$$
H_a:μ <= 25
$$

Test Statistics:

$$
T= \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{S/ \sqrt{n}} = \frac{20.3 - 25}{5/ \sqrt{21}} = -4.31
$$

From the t-table, for $\alpha = 0.05$ in a two-tailed test:

$$
-t_{20,0.05} = -1.725
$$

Since -4.31 < -1.725, we non-reject $H_0$.

### b.

Posttreatment : $\bar{x} = 26.6, s = 7.4, n = 21$

Construct a 95% CI:

$$
t_{20,0.025} = 2.086, \sigma \approx s
$$  

$$
\mu \in \bar{x} \pm t_{n-1 , \alpha/2} \frac{sigma}{\sqrt{n}}, \alpha = 0.05
$$

$$
\mu \in26.6 \pm 2.086 \frac{7.4}{\sqrt{21}} \approx (23.23, 29.97)
$$

Thus, the CI is:

$$
(23.23, 29.97)
$$

### c.

From the table we can observe that there is an increase in the sample means from pretreatment to posttreatment and posttreatment to follow-up. It suggest that the treatment had a significant effect, and the effect can last over time.
