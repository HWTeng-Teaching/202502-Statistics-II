## Solution

From the graph, we can observe that the points lie approximately along a straight line, indicating that the data likely come from a normal distribution.

## Solution

If the points closely follow the straight line in the normal probability plot, we can conclude that the data likely come from a normal distribution. Conversely, if the points deviate significantly from the straight line, it suggests that the data do not originate from a normal distribution.
