## Solution

### a.

According to data:

$n=27, \bar{x}=1.0522, s=0.1657,μ = 1$

Hypothesis Test:

$$
H_0:μ = 1
$$

$$
H_a: \mu \neq 1
$$


$$
\text{Set } \alpha = 0.05
$$

**T-Value Analysis:**

$$
t_{STAT} \sim t_{n-1}
$$

$$
T-value = 1.64
$$

$$
df = n - 1 = 27 - 1 = 26
$$

$$
t_{26, 0.025} = 2.056
$$

$$
\text{Rejection region: } t < -2.056 \text{ or } t > 2.056
$$

Since t = 1.64 < 2.056, we do not reject $H_0$.

There is no significant evidence to suggest that the mean weight of ground beef packages differs from 1.

**P-value analysis:**

if $P-value < \alpha$, reject $H_0$.

$$
P-value = 0.113
$$

Since 0.113 > 0.05, we do not reject $H_0$.

There is no significant evidence to suggest that the mean weight of ground beef packages differs from 1.

**By estimation procedures:**

Construct 95% CI for $\mu$, if $\bar{x}$ is not in CI, reject $H_0$.

$$
\mu \in (0.9867, 1.1178)
$$

Since $\bar{x}=1.0522$ is in CI, we do not reject $H_0$.

There is no significant evidence that the mean weight of packages of ground beef is different from 1.

### b.

**Calculate T-value:**

$$
t^* = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{s/\sqrt{n}}
$$

$$
t^* = \frac{1.0522 - 1}{0.1657/\sqrt{27}} = 1.637 \approx 1.64
$$

T-value is approximately the same with MINITAB.

**Construct the CI:**

$$
\mu \in \bar{x} \pm t_{n - 1, \alpha/2} \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}, \alpha = 0.05
$$

$$
t_{26, 0.025} = 2.056, \sigma \approx s
$$

$$
\mu \in 1.0522 \pm 2.056 \frac{0.1657}{\sqrt{27}}
$$

$$
\mu \in (0.9867, 1.1178)
$$

CI is approximately the same with MINITAB.

Thus, T-value = 1.64, UCL = 1.1178, LCL = 0.9867.
