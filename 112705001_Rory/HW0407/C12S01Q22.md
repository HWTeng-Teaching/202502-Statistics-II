The graph appears to be a positive linear relationship between armspan and height, which is an upward trend.

Therefore, the two variables have a positive correlation.

### b.

If a person's wingspan is about the same as their height, the slope of the regression line should be near to 1.

### c.

$$
S_{xy} = \sum xy - \frac{\sum x \sum y}{n}= 221414 - \frac{1328 \times 1331}{8} = 468
$$

$$
S_{xx} = \sum x^2 - \frac{(\sum x)^2}{n}= 221016 - \frac{1328^2}{8} = 568
$$

$$
b = \frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}} = \frac{468}{568} = 0.8239
$$

$$
a = \bar{y} - b\bar{x} = 29.6
$$

The least-squares regression line is

$\hat{y} = 29.6 + 0.8239x$  

The value of slope b is close to 1, confirming my conclusion in part b.

### d.

$\hat{y} = 29.6 + 0.8293 \times 157 = 158.96$  

A person with an armspan of 157 is predicted to be approximately 158.96.
