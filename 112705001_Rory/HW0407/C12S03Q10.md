## Solution

### a.

According to the table, $b = -1.251 \quad \quad a = 93.617$
$\hat{y} = a + bx \Rightarrow \hat{y} = 93.617 - 1.251x$  

### (b)

$H_0: \beta = 0 \quad \quad$

$H_a: \beta \neq 0$

$Set \alpha = 0.05$  
  
The test statistic and its sampling distribution:

$$
t_{\text{STAT}} = \frac{b-0}{\sqrt{MSE/S_{xx}}} \sim t_{(n-2)=5}
$$

The realized statistic:

$$
t^* = -10.471
$$

Reject $H_0$ if t < -t_{5;0.025} = -2.571
  
Since -10.471 < -2.571, we reject $H_0$.

The data provides sufficient evidence to indicate that x and y are linearly related.

### c.

Construct a 95% CI for the slope of the line:

the lower limit: $-1.559$
$\text{the upper limit} = b + t_{5,0.025} \* \sqrt{\frac{MSE}{S_{xx}}} = -1.251 + 2.571\*0.12 \approx -0.942$  
$\text{standard error of} b  = \sqrt{\frac{MSE}{S_{xx}}} = 0.12$  

### d.

$R^2 = 0.9564$  
That is, about 97.23% of the variability in the percentage arrested can be explained by the linear relationship with group median age. $r^2=0.9723$ indicates a very effective linear regression model.
