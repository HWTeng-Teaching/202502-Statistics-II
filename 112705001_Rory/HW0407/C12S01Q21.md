## Solution

### a.

Predicting the actual measurement as a function of the estimated measurement.

$\hat{y} = a + bx$  

$$
S_{xy} = \sum xy - \frac{\sum x \sum y}{n}= 14922.41 - \frac{264.9 \times 272}{10} = 7717.13
$$

$$
S_{xx} = \sum x^2 - \frac{(\sum x)^2}{n}= 14935.37 - \frac{264.9^2}{10} = 7918.169
$$

$$
b = \frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}} = \frac{7717.13}{7918.169} = 0.9746
$$

$$
a = \bar{y} - b\bar{x} = 1.38257
$$

The least-squares regression line is

$$
\hat{y} = 1.38257 + 0.97461x
$$


### b.

Since the points are close to the least-squares regression line, the assumption of a linear relationship appears to be reasonable.
