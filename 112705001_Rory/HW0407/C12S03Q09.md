## Solution

### a.

$\hat{y} = a + bx$  

$$
S_{xy} = \sum xy - \frac{\sum x \sum y}{n}= 132.8 - \frac{120 \times 16.66}{16} = 7.85
$$

$$
S_{xx} = \sum x^2 - \frac{(\sum x)^2}{n}= 1240 - \frac{120^2}{16} = 340
$$

$$
b = \frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}} = \frac{7.85}{340} \approx 0.0231
$$

$$
a = \bar{y} - b\bar{x} = 1.04125 + 0.023 \times 7.5 = 0.8681
$$

The least-squares regression line is

$$
\hat{y} = 0.8681 + 0.0231x
$$

### b.

$H_0: \beta = 0$

$H_a: \beta \neq 0$  

$\text{Set } \alpha = 0.05$  

The test statistic and its sampling distribution:

$$
t_{STAT} = \frac{b-0}{\sqrt{MSE/S_{xx}}} \sim t_{n-2}
$$

The realized statistic:

$$
t^* = \frac{b-0}{\sqrt{MSE/S_{xx}}} = \frac{0.0231}{\sqrt{0.000367/(1240-16*56.25)}} = 7.031
$$

Reject $H_0$ if t > $t_{14,0.025}$ = 2.145

Since 7.031 > 2.145, we reject $H_0$

There is a linear relationship between the number of miles of roadways and the year.

### c.

$$
TSS = S_{yy} = \sum y^2 - \frac{(\sum y)^2}{n} = 17.5336 - \frac{16.66^2}{5} = 0.186375
$$

$$
SSR = \frac{S_{xy}^2}{Syy} = \frac{7.85^2}{340} = 0.181243
$$

$$
SSE = 0.186375 - 0.181243 = 0.005132
$$

$$
MSE = \frac{SSE}{n-2} = \frac{0.005132}{14} = 0.000367
$$

$$
MSR = \frac{SSR}{1} = 0.181243
$$
  
$$
MSE = \frac{SSE}{n-2} = \frac{0.005132}{14} = 0.000367
$$
  
$$
F = \frac{MSR}{MSE} = \frac{0.181243}{0.000367} = 493.85
$$

Construct the ANOVA table:

| Source     | df | SS       | MS       | F      |
|:-----------|:---|:---------|:---------|:-------|
| Regression | 1  | 0.181243 | 0.181243 | 493.85 |
| Error      | 14 | 0.005132 | 0.000367 |        |
| Total      | 15 | 0.186375 |          |        |

$H_0$: model is not useful in explaining the response varuable

$H_a$: model is useful in explaining the response varuable

$\text{Set } \alpha = 0.05$

The test statistic and its sampling distribution:

$$
F_{STAT} = \frac{MSR}{MSE} \sim F_{1,n-2}
$$

The realized statistic:

$$
F_{1,14} = \frac{MSR}{MSE} = \frac{0.181243}{0.000367} = 493.85
$$

Reject $H_0$ if F > $F_{1,14,0.05}$ = 4.6001

Since 493.85 > 4.6001, we reject $H_0$.

There is a linear relationship between the number of miles of roadways and the year.

$$
t_{STAT}^2 = (\frac{b-0}{\sqrt{MSE/S_{xx}}})^2 = \frac{b^2}{MSE/S_{xx}} = \frac{b^2 S_{xx}}{MSE} = \frac{S_{xy}^2}{S_{xx}^2} \times \frac{S_{xx}}{MSE} = \frac{S_{xy}^2}{S_{xx} MSE} = \frac{SSR}{MSE} = \frac{SSR/1}{MSE} = \frac{MSR}{MSE} = F_{STAT}
$$

We can verify that the square of the t-statistic is equal to the square of the F-statistic.

---

### d.

$$
r^2 = \frac{SSR}{TSS} = \frac{0.181243}{0.186375} = 0.9725
$$

This means that 97.25% of the variation in the miles of roadways can be explained by a linear relationship with year. This indicates that the regression model fits the data very well.
