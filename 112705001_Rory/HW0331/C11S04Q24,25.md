## Solution of 24

### a.
  
blocks: items  
treatments: stores  
  
### b.
$H_0: $\mu_1 = \mu_2 = \mu_3 = \mu_4 \quad \quad$

$H_a$: at least one mean is different

Set $\alpha = 0.05$  
  
Test statistic and its sampling distribution:

$$
F_{\text{STAT}} = \frac{MST}{MSE} \sim F_{(k-1),(k-1)(b-1) = 3,21}
$$

Realized statistic:

$$
F^* = 26.52
$$

Reject $H_0$ if $F>F_{3,21;0.05} = 3.07$
  
Since 26.52 > 3.07, we reject $H_0$.

There is a significant difference in prices from store to store.

### c.

$H_0: \mu_A = \mu_B = ... = \mu_H \quad \quad$

$H_a$: at least one mean is different

Set $\alpha = 0.05$ 
  
Test statistic and its sampling distribution:

$$
F_{\text{STAT}} = \frac{MST}{MSE} \sim F_{(b-1),(k-1)(b-1) = 7,21}
$$

Realized statistic:

$$
F^* = 35.32
$$

Reject $H_0$ if $F>F_{7,21;0.05} = 2.4876$

Since 35.32 > 2.4876, we reject $H_0$.
  
There is significant difference from block to block, which means blocking is effective.

## Solution of 25

### a.

$k = \text{Number of groups} = 4$

$b = \text{Number of blocks} = 8$

$\bar{x}_1 = \text{Sample mean} = 4.1350$

$\bar{x}_2 = \text{Sample mean} = 4.3400$

$\bar{x}_3 = \text{Sample mean} = 3.8525$

$\bar{x}_4 = \text{Sample mean} = 2.5975$

$df_E = 21$

$q_{0.05}(4,21) \approx 3.942$

#### b.

$$
\omega = q_{\alpha}(k, N-k) \times \sqrt{\frac{MSE}{n_t}} = q_{0.05}(4, 21) \times \sqrt{\frac{0.1658}{8}} = 5.19 \times \sqrt{\frac{0.1658}{8}} = 0.7472
$$

#### c.

Store Means:  ) 
| Store       | Mean Price |  
|-------------|------------|  
| WinCo       | 2.68125    |  
| Stater Bros | 3.85250    |  
| Vons        | 4.13500    |  
| Ralphs      | 4.34000    |  

| Comparison               | Difference         | Significant? |  
|--------------------------|--------------------|--------------|  
| WinCo vs. Ralphs         | 1.65875 < 0.7472   | Yes          |  
| WinCo vs. Vons           | 1.45375 < 0.7472   | Yes          |  
| WinCo vs. Stater Bros    | 1.17125 < 0.7472   | Yes          |  
| Stater Bros vs. Ralphs   | 0.48750 > 0.7472   | No           |  
| Stater Bros vs. Vons     | 0.28250 > 0.7472   | No           |  
| Vons vs. Ralphs          | 0.20500 > 0.7472   | No           |  

The mean of the Winco store is significantly different from the mean of all other stores, whereas the means of the other pairs of stores are not significantly different.
