## Solution

### a.

$H_0: \mu_A = \mu_B = \mu_c \quad \quad$ 

$H_a$: at least one mean is different
  
Set $\alpha = 0.01$

Test statistic and its sampling distribution:

$$
F_{\text{STAT}} = \frac{MST}{MSE} \sim F_{(k-1),(n-k) = 2,9}
$$

Realized statistic:

$$
F^* = 5.704
$$

$p-value = P(F_{2,9} > F^*) = 0.0251$

Since p-value = 0.0251 > 0.01, we fail to reject $H_0$.

There is no significant difference in mean assembly times for people trained by the three programs.

### b.

99% CI for the difference in means of A and B ($\mu_A-\mu_B$):

$$
(\bar{x}_A - \bar{x}_B) \pm t\_{0.01/2;9} * \sqrt{MSE*(\frac{1}{n_A} + \frac{1}{n_B})} = (60.5- 54.667) \pm 3.250 * \sqrt{14.941*(\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{3})} = (-3.77 , 15.43)
$$

### c.

99% CI for the mean of A ($\mu_A$):

$$
\bar{x}_A \pm t\_{0.01/2;4-1} * \frac{s_A}{\sqrt{n_A}} = 60.5 \pm 5.841 * \sqrt{\frac{9.667}{4}} = (51.4196, 69.5804)
$$

### d.

Because within each group, there is no extreme outlier and the shape of the data does not appear to be severely skewed and is fairly symmetrical, we can say that the data was selected from the normal population.
