## Solution

### a.

The paired-difference test (parametric), the Wilcoxon signed-rank test (nonparametric), and the sign test are all suitable for testing differences in the distribution of recall scores with and without imagery.

The paired-difference test relies on the following assumptions:

1.Each observation in one group must be uniquely matched to an observation in the other group.

2.The differences between pairs must be independent of one another.

3.The distribution of the differences should be approximately normal.

In this case, the data meet the first two assumptions: each observation is uniquely paired across conditions, and the differences between pairs are independent. However, the distribution of the differences does not appear to be normal, as the middle values are relatively sparse compared to those at both ends. Therefore, the assumption of normality is not satisfied.


### b.

|Pair| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7  | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11| 12| 13| 14| 15| 16| 17| 18| 19| 20|
|:--:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-: |:-:|:-:|:-: |:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|A-B | 15| 15| 15| 9 | 16| 8 | 12 | 8 | 10| 12 | 9 | 4 | 10| 4 | 17| 13| 4 | 7 | 7 | 10|
|rank| 17| 17| 17|8.5| 19|6.5|13.5|6.5| 11|13.5|8.5| 2 | 11| 2 | 20| 15| 2 |4.5|4.5| 11|

#### The Sign Test:  
  
$H_0 : p = 0.5$

$H_a : p \neq 0.5$  
   
$\alpha = 0.05$  
    
Test statistic: $x = \\#(+) , n=20$  
  
Realized statistic: $x=20$  
  
$p-value = 2*P(x \geq 20) = 2\* (1 - P(x \leq 19)) = 0$

Since $0 < 0.5$, we reject $H_0$, which means that there is significant difference in the distributions of recall scores under these two conditions.

#### The Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test:  

$T^+ = 210$  
  
$T^- = 0$  
  
$H_0 : p = 0.5$ 

$H_a : p \neq 0.5$  
   
$\alpha = 0.05$  
    
Test statistic: $T = min(T^+, T^-) , n=20$  
  
Realized statistic: $T = min(T^+, T^-) = min(210,0) = 0$  
  
Rejection region: $\\{T | T \leq 52 \\}$    
  
Since $0 < 52$, we reject $H_0$, which means that there is significant difference in the distributions of recall scores under these two conditions.  

### c.

Both tests reject the null hypothesis. The consistency between the two tests strengthens the evidence that imagery instructions significantly enhance word recall compared to the absence of such instructions. The uniformly positive differences further underscore the clarity and strength of this effect.
