## Solution

| Group | Rank Sum |
| ----- | ------------- |
| 10–19 | 263           |
| 20–39 | 210           |
| 40–59 | 228           |
| 60–69 | 239           |

$T_1 = 23 \quad \quad T_2 = 29.5 \quad \quad T_3 = 19.5 \quad \quad T_4 = 8$

$k=4 \quad \quad b=8$

### a.

$H_0$: 4 distributions are identical

$H_a$: at least one distribution is different

$\alpha = 0.05$

Test statistic:

$$
H_{STAT} = \frac{12}{n(n+1)} \sum \frac{T_i^2}{n_i} - 3(n+1) \sim \chi^2_{(k-1)}
$$

Realized statistic:

$$
H=\frac{12}{N(N+1)} \sum(\frac{T_i^2}{n_i}) -3(N+1) = \frac{12}{40(40+1)} (\frac{263^2}{10}+\frac{210^2}{10}+\frac{228^2}{10}+\frac{239^2}{10})-3(40+1) \approx 39.6
$$

Rejection region: $\\{F_r: F_r > \chi^2_{3;0.05} =  7.81473\\}$

Since $18.2625$ falls into the rejection region, we reject $H_0$, which means there is significant difference between the distribution of the prices.


### b.

$p-value = P(F_r > 18.2625) < 0.005 < 0.05 = \alpha$

Therefore, we reject $H_0$, which means there is significant difference between the distribution of the prices.
