## Solution

|rank| T1| T2| T3| T4|
|:--:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| B1 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 |
| B2 |3.5|3.5| 2 | 1 |
| B3 |2.5| 4 |2.5| 1 |
| B4 | 3 | 4 | 2 | 1 |
| B5 | 2 |3.5|3.5| 1 |
| B6 | 2 |3.5|3.5| 1 |
| B7 | 3 | 4 | 2 | 1 |
| B8 | 3 | 4 | 2 | 1 |

$k = 4$

$b = 8$  
  
$T_1 = 23$

$T_2 = 29$

$T_3 = 19.5$

$T_4 = 8$  

### a.

$H_0$: 4 distributions are identical

$H_a$: at least one distribution is different

$\alpha = 0.05$

Test statistic:

$$
F_{r,STAT} = \frac{12}{bk(k+1)} \sum T_i^2 - 3b(k+1) \sim \chi^2_{(k-1)}
$$

Realized statistic:

$$
F_r^* = \frac{12}{8*4\*5} \sum (23^2 + 29.5^2 + 19.5^2+ 8^2) - 3\*8\*5 = 18.2625
$$

Rejection region: $\\{F_r: F_r > \chi^2_{3;0.05}\\} = \\{F_r: F_r > 7.81473\\}$

Since $18.2625$ falls into the rejection region, we reject $H_0$, which means there is significant difference between the distribution of the prices.


### b.

$p-value = P(F_r > 18.2625) < 0.005 < 0.05 = \alpha$

Therefore, we reject $H_0$, which means there is significant difference between the distribution of the prices.
