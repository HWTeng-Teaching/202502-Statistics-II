## Solution

$n_1 = 9$

$n_2 = 9$

$H_0$ : the two population distributions are the same

$H_a$ : the two population distributions are in some way different

$\alpha=0.05$

Test statistic:

$$
T_{STAT} = min(T_1,T_1^*)
$$

Realized statistic: 

$$
T^* = min(45,126) = 45
$$

5. Reject $H_0$ if $T \leq T_{0.025} = 62$

6. Because 45 \leq 62, we reject $H_0$, which means that the distributions of eye-movement rates for deaf children and hearing children differ.
