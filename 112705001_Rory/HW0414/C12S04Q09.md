## Solution

### a.

Since $r^2 = 0.027$ is very small, we can assume that there is little correlation between screen size and price.

### b.

In the normal probability plot, these points are following the regression line. Therefore, it apeears that the normality assumption is not violated.

In the versus fits, it shows a weak relationship. Therfore, it apeears that the equal variance assumption is violated.

### c.

There is no clear relation between size and price, so the assumption of linearity is violated.
