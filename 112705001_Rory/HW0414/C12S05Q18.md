## Solution

### a.

<img width="400" alt="img" src=https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f2b9af53-37e0-4dd9-b2dc-73d80a3c0315/>

We can observe a positive correlation between P applied to the soil and P present in the plant, with some variation within the same X .

### b.

$\bar{x}=0.2834$

$\bar{y}=157.5834$

$\hat{y} =  a + bx$

$$
b = \frac{SXY}{SXX} = \frac{88.4667}{0.3267} = 270.82
$$

$$
a = \bar{y}-b\bar{x} =  80.85
$$

The regrssion line is 

$$
\hat{y} = 80.9 + 270.8x
$$

### c.

$H_0: \quad b = 0$  

$H_a: \quad b \neq 0$  

$\alpha = 0.05$

Use t statistic,

Since p-value = 0.003 < 0.05$, we reject $H_0$

The data provides sufficient evidence that the amount of phosphorus present in plants is linearly related to the amount of phosphorus applied to the soil.

#### d.


$t_{n-2,0.1} = t_{10,0.1} = 1.812$

$x_0 = 0.20$

$SE_{\hat{y}} = s \cdot \sqrt{ \frac{1}{n} + \frac{(x_0 - \bar{x})^2}{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2} } = 12.6264$

$s=\sqrt{\frac{\sum (y_i - \hat{y_i})^2}{n-2}} = 39.04190$

According to the information provided in the table, the 90% CI is

$$
(112.130, 157.900)
$$
