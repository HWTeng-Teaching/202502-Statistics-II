## Solution

### a.

x: body temperature
y: heart rate
y is related to x

$$
r = 0.1741
$$

### b.

$H_0: \quad \rho = 0$  
$H_a: \quad \rho \neq 0$  

$\alpha = 0.05$  

Use t-statistic,

$$
t_{STAT} = r \times \sqrt{\frac{n-2}{1-r^2}} \sim t_{n-2}
$$

$$
t^* = 0.1741 \times \sqrt{\frac{10}{1-0.1741^2}} = 0.5591
$$

Reject $H_0$ if t > t_{10,0.025} = 2.228

Since 0.5591 < 2.228, we fail to reject $H_0$.

There is no sufficient evidence to indicate that there is a correlation between these two variables.
