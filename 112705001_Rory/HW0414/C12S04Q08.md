## Solution

### a.

1. The relationship between the independent variable x and the dependent variable y is linear. $y = \alpha + \beta x + \epsilon$
2. The values of random error term $\epsilon$ are independent.
3. The random errors should be obtained from a normal distribution with mean 0, and a constant variance σ.

### b.

The best estimate of $\sigma^2$ is 58.05.

### c.

In the normal probability plot, there is skewness in the tails, so the residuals appear non-normal, which violates the normal distribution assumption.  
In the residuals versus fits plot, the points are not randomly scattered around y = 0. This violates the assumption of equal variances.
