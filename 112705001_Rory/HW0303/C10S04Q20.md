## Solution

Define $X_A$: with imagery, $X_B$: without imagery.

$$
D_i = X_{Ai} - X_{Bi}, \text { for i = 1,...,20}
$$
$$
\bar{D} = \frac{15+15+15+9+16+8+12+8+10+12+9+4+10+4+17+13+4+7+7+10}{20} = 10.25
$$

$$
S_D=4.051
$$

Hypothesis Test:

$$
H_0: \mu_A-\mu_B = 0, H_1: \mu_A-\mu_B >0
$$
$$
\text{set } \alpha = 0.05
$$

Test statistic and its sampling distribution:

$$
t_{STAT} = \frac{\bar{D} - 0}{S_D/\sqrt{n}} \sim t_{n-1} = \frac{10.25 - 0}{4.051/\sqrt{20}} = 11.316
$$

$$
t_{n-1,\alpha} = t_{19,0.05} = \pm 1.729
$$
$$
\text{Reject region: } t > 1.729 
$$

Since $t^*=11.316 > 1.729$, we reject $H_0$.

There is sufficient evidence that the average recall score is higher when imagery is used.
