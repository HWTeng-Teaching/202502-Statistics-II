## Solution

### a.
$$
D_i = A_i - B_i
$$
$$
\bar{D} = \frac{0.006+(-0.018)+(-0.014)+(-0.011)+(-0.004)+(-0.019)}{6} = -0.01
$$
$$
S_D=0.0095
$$

Hypothesis Test:

$$
H_0: \mu_A-\mu_B = 0
$$
$$
H_1: \mu_A-\mu_B \neq 0
$$
$$
\text{set } \alpha = 0.05
$$

Test statistic and its sampling distribution:

$$
t_{STAT} = \frac{\bar{d} - 0}{S_d/\sqrt{n}} \sim t_{n-1}
$$

Calculating:

$$
t^* = \frac{-0.01 - 0}{0.0095/\sqrt{6}} = -2.578
$$
$$
t_{n-1,\alpha/2} = t_{5,0.025} = \pm 2.571
$$
$$
\text{Rejection region: } t > 2.571 \text{ or } t < 2.571
$$

Since $t^*$ = 2.578 > 2.571, we reject $H_0$.

There is sufficient evidence to indicate a difference between the average densities of cakes prepared using the two types of batter.

### b.

Construct a 95% CI of $\mu_A -\mu_B$:

$$
\bar{D} \pm t_{n-1,\alpha/2}\frac{S_D}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

Calculating:

$$
-0.01\pm t_{5,0.025}\frac{0.0095}{\sqrt{6}} = -0.01\pm 2.571\frac{0.0095}{\sqrt{6}} = (-0.01997,-0.00003)
$$

Thus, the CI is

$$
(-0.01997,-0.00003)
$$

Since 0 is not in the confidence interval, there is sufficient evidence to indicate a difference between the average densities of cakes prepared using the two types of batter.
