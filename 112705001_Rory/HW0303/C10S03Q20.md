## Solution

### a.

Above Town:

$$
\bar{X}_A = \frac{4.8+5.2+5.0+4.9+5.1}{5} = 5.0
$$
$$
{S_A}^2=0.025
$$

Below Town: 

$$
\bar{X}_B = \frac{5.0+4.7+4.9+4.8+4.9}{5} = 4.86
$$
$$
{S_B}^2=0.013
$$

Hypothesis Test:

$$
H_0: \mu_A-\mu_B = 0
$$
$$
H_1:\mu_A - \mu_B >0
$$
$$
\text{set } \alpha = 0.05
$$

By Rule of Thumb, 

$$
\frac{larger \ s^2}{smaller \ s^2} = \frac{0.025}{0.013} \approx 1.923 < 3
$$

Thus,

$$
{\sigma_A}^2 = {\sigma_B}^2
$$

**Pool Estimator:**

$$
S^2 = \frac{(n_A - 1){S_A}^2+(n_B - 1){S_B}^2}{n_1 + n_2 - 2} =\frac{(5 - 1) 0.025 + (5 - 1) 0.013}{5 + 5 - 2} = 0.019
$$

Test statistic and its sampling distribution:

$$
t_{\text{STAT}} = \frac{(\bar{X}_A - \bar{X}_B) -D_0}{\sqrt{S^2 * (\frac{1}{n_A} + \frac{1}{n_B}})} \sim t\_{n_A+n_B-2} = \frac{(5.0 - 4.86) - 0}{\sqrt{0.019(\frac{1}{5}+\frac{1}{5})}} = 1.606
$$

$$
t_{{n_A + n_B - 2},\alpha} = t_{8,0.05} = 1.860
$$

Rejection region:

$$
t > 1.860 \text{ or } t < 1.860
$$

Since t = 1.606 < 1.860, we do not reject $H_0$.

There is no sufficient evidence to indicate that the mean oxygen content below the town is less than the mean oxygen content above.

### b.
Construct a 95% CI of $\mu_A -\mu_B$:

$$
(\bar{X}_A-\bar{X}_B ) \pm t\_{{n_A+n_B-2},\alpha/2}\sqrt{(\frac{1}{n_A}+\frac{1}{n_B})S^2}
$$

Calculating:

$$
(5.0 - 4.86)\pm t_{8,0.025}\sqrt{(\frac{1}{5}+\frac{1}{5})0.019 ^ 2}=(5.0 - 4.6)\pm 2.306\sqrt{(\frac{1}{5}+\frac{1}{5})0.019} = (-0.061,0.341)
$$

Thus, the CI is:

$$
(-0.061,0.341)
$$

Since the interval includes 0, there is no sufficient evidence that there has the difference in the mean.
