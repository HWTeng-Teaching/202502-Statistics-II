## Solution

Define:

$$
\text{A: Stimulus 1, B: Stimulus 2}
$$

Denote:

$$
D_i = A_i - B_i
$$
$$
\bar{D} = \frac{(-1) + (-1) + (-2) + 1 + (-1) + (-1) + 0 + (-1)}{8} = -0.75
$$
$$
S_D=0.886
$$

Hypothesis Test:

$$
H_0: \mu_A-\mu_B = 0
$$
$$
H_1: \mu_A-\mu_B \neq 0
$$
$$
\text{set } \alpha = 0.05
$$

Test statistic and its sampling distribution:

$$
t_{STAT} = \frac{\bar{d} - 0}{S_d/\sqrt{n}} \sim t_{n-1}
$$

Calculating:

$$
t^* = \frac{-0.75 - 0}{0.886/\sqrt{8}} = -2.394
$$
$$
t_{n-1,\alpha/2} = t_{7,0.025} = \pm 2.365
$$

Rejection region:

$$
t > 2.365 \text{ or } t < 2.365
$$

Since $t^*$ = 2.394 > 2.365, we reject $H_0$.

Thus, there is sufficient evidence that the data present sufficient evidence to indicate a differece in mean reactio times for the two stimuli.
