## Solution

### a.

|Pair| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |
|:--:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|A-B | -4| 2 | -2| -5| -3| 0 | 1 | 1 | -6|
|rank| 6 |3.5|3.5| 7 | 5 | no|1.5|1.5| 8 |
  
$T^+ = 3.5 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6.5$  
  
$T^- = 6 + 3.5 + 7 + 5 + 8 = 29.5$  
  
$H_0 : p = 0.5

$H_a : p \neq 0.5$  
   
$\alpha = 0.05$  
    
Test statistic: $T = min(T^+, T^-) , n = 8$  
 
Realized statistic: $T = min(T^+, T^-) = min(6.5,29.5) = 6.5$
  
Rejection region: $\\{T | T \leq 4 \\}$    

Since $6.5 > 4$, we fail to reject $H_0$, which means that the data provide no sufficient evidence to indicate a difference in the monthly breakdown rates for the two machines.  

### b.

The machine may be operated at different workloads or by different operators, resulting in inconsistent stress and wear. Additionally, environmental conditions such as temperature or humidity may affect its performance differently from month to month.
