## Solution

Define: Chemistry as group 1, Physics as group 2 

Denote:

$$
\bar{x}_1 = 784, \bar{x}_2 = 758
$$
$$
s_1 = 114, s_2 = 103
$$
$$
n_1 = 15, n_2 = 15
$$

Degrees of Freedom:

Numerator

$$
df_1 = n_1 - 1 = 15 - 1 = 14
$$

Denominator

$$
df_2 = n_2 - 1 = 15 - 1 = 14
$$

Hypothesis Test (two-tailed test):

$$
H_0: \sigma_1^2 = \sigma_2^2
$$
$$
H_a: \sigma_1^2 \neq \sigma_2^2
$$
$$
\text{set } \alpha = 0.05
$$

Test Statistic:

Using the F-test,

$$
F = \frac{\text{Larger Variance}}{\text{Smaller Variance}} = \frac{s_1^2}{s_2^2} = \frac{12996}{10609} \approx 1.225
$$

Using the F-distribution table,

$$
F_{14,14,0.05} \approx 0.4
$$

Since 0.4 > 0.05, we do not reject $H_0$.

Therefore, there is no significant difference in population variances, indicating equality of variances and proceeding to the pooled variances T-test.
