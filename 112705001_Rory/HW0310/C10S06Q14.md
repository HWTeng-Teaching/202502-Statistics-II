## Solution

- Hypothesis Test (one-tailed test):

$$
H_0: \sigma_1^2 = \sigma_2^2
$$
$$
H_1:\sigma_1^2 < \sigma_2^2
$$
$$
\text{set: } \alpha = 0.05
$$

Test statistic:

Using the F-test,

$$
\quad \quad F_{\text{STAT}} = \frac{S_1^2}{S_2^2} \sim F_{(n_1 - 1), (n_2 - 1)}
$$

Calculating:

$$
F = \frac{28.2^2}{15.6^2} = 3.27
$$

- Critical Value and p-value:

Degrees of freedom:

$$
df_1 = n_1 - 1 = 30 - 1 = 29
$$
$$
df_2 = n_2 - 1 = 30 - 1 = 29
$$

Using the F-table, the critical value is

$$
F_{0.05,29,29} = 1.86
$$

Since 3.27 > 1.86, we reject $H_0$. 

Therefore, we conclude that the older system has significantly higher variability.
