## Solution

### a.

Denote:

$$
\bar{x}_1 = 40.33,\bar{x}_2 = 42.54
$$
$$
s_1^2 = 1.54,s_2^2 = 2.96
$$
$$
n_1 = 15,n_2 = 15
$$

Degrees of Freedom:

Numerator

$$
df_1 = n_2 - 1 = 15 - 1 = 14
$$
 
Denominator
 
$$
df_2 = n_1 - 1 = 15 - 1 = 14
$$

Hypothesis Test (two-tailed test):

$$
H_0: \sigma_1^2 = \sigma_2^2
$$
$$
H_1: \sigma_1^2 \neq \sigma_2^2
$$
$$
\text{set } \alpha = 0.05
$$

Test Statistic:

Using the F-test,

$$
F = \frac{s_2^2}{s_1^2}
$$

Calculating,

$$
F = \frac{2.96}{1.54} \approx 1.92
$$

Using the F-distribution table, the p-value is approximately 0.23

Since 0.24 > 0.05, we do not reject $H_0$

Therefore, there is no significant evidence of a difference in variances, indicating equality of variances.

### b.

Construct a 99% CI for the Ratio of Population Variances:

$$
(\frac{s_2^2}{s_1^2} \times \frac{1}{F_{\alpha / 2, df_1, df_2}}, \frac{s_2^2}{s_1^2} \times F_{\alpha / 2, df_2, df_1})
$$

Calculating,

$$
(\frac{s_2^2}{s_1^2} \times F_{0.995, 14, 14}}, \frac{s_2^2}{s_1^2} \times F_{0.005, 14, 14}) = (1.922 \times \frac{1}{3.926}, 1.922 \times 3.065) = (0.49, 5.89)
$$
  
Thus, the CI is

$$
(0.49, 5.89)
$$

Since the interval includes 1, there is no significant difference in variances at the 99% confidence level.
