## Solution

Degrees of freedom:

$$
df_1 = 3
$$
$$
df_2 = 2
$$

By the rule of thumb, two variances are the same if $F = \frac{\text{Larger Variance}}{\text{Smaller Variance}} < 3$

that is,

$$
F_{3,2} = \frac{S_1^2}{S_2^2}
$$

The significance level $\alpha$ is 

$$
P(\text{type I error}) = P(F_{3,2}>3) + P(F_{3,2}<\frac{1}{3}) \approx 0.48.
$$
