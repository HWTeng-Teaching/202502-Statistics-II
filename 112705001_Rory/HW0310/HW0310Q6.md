## Solution

Degrees of freedom:

$$
df_1 = 3
$$
$$
df_2 = 2
$$

By the rule of thumb, two variances can be considered approximately equal if F = \frac{\text{Larger Variance}}{\text{Smaller Variance}} < 3

Use the F-distribution table:
For $\alpha = 0.10$, $F_{0.10, 3, 2} \approx 9.55$
For $\alpha = 0.05$, $F_{0.05, 3, 2} \approx 19.16$
For $\alpha = 0.01$, $F_{0.01, 3, 2} \approx 99.59$

Since the rule of thumb uses an approximate cutoff of 4, this corresponds roughly to an **alpha level between 0.20 and 0.25**.
