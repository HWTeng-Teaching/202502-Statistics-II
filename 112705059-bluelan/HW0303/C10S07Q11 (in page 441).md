### Solution

- **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** (μ₁ = μ₂).
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** (μ₁ ≠ μ₂).

For each person, calculate the difference in reaction times (D = Stimulus 1 - Stimulus 2):

| Person | Stimulus 1 | Stimulus 2 | Difference (D) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1    | 1    | 4    | -3    |
| 2    | 3    | 2    | 1    |
| 3    | 2    | 3    | -1    |
| 4    | 1    | 3    | -2    |
| 5    | 2    | 1    | 1    |
| 6    | 1    | 2    | -1    |
| 7    | 3    | 3    | 0    |
| 8    | 2    | 3    | -1    |

- **Mean of Differences (D̄):**

$$D̄ = \frac{\sum D}{n} = \frac{-3 + 1 - 1 - 2 + 1 - 1 + 0 - 1}{8} = \frac{-6}{8} = -0.75$$

- **Standard Deviation of Differences (s_D):**

$$s_D = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (D - D̄)^2}{n-1}}$$

$$s_D = \sqrt{\frac{13.5}{7}} \approx \sqrt{1.9286} \approx 1.389$$

$$
t = \frac{D̄}{s_D / \sqrt{n}} = \frac{-0.75}{1.389 / \sqrt{8}} \approx \frac{-0.75}{0.491} \approx -1.528
$$

For a two-tailed test with α = 0.05 and degrees of freedom (df) = n - 1 = 7, the critical t-value from the t-distribution table is approximately ±2.365.

Since | -1.528 | < 2.365, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.

Conclusion
There is not sufficient evidence at the 0.05 significance level to conclude that there is a significant difference in mean reaction times between the two stimuli.
