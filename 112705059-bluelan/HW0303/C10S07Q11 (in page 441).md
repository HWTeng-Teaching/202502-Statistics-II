### Solution

- **Null Hypothesis**: $H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2$(No difference in mean reaction times)
- **Alternative Hypothesis**: $H_A: \mu_1 \neq \mu_2$ (Reaction times are different)
- **Significance Level**: $\alpha = 0.05$

Given reaction times:

| Person | Stimulus 1 | Stimulus 2 | Difference (\( d \)) |
|--------|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| 1      | 1         | 4         | -3             |
| 2      | 3         | 2         | 1              |
| 3      | 2         | 3         | -1             |
| 4      | 1         | 3         | -2             |
| 5      | 2         | 1         | 1              |
| 6      | 1         | 2         | -1             |
| 7      | 3         | 3         | 0              |
| 8      | 2         | 3         | -1             |
| 9      | 1         | 3         | -2             |
| 10     | 3         | 3         | 0              |
| 11     | 2         | 3         | -1             |
| 12     | 1         | 3         | -2             |
| 13     | 1         | 2         | -1             |
| 14     | 3         | 3         | 0              |
| 15     | 2         | 3         | -1             |
| 16     | 2         | 3         | -1             |

- Compute mean and standard deviation of d:

$$
\bar{d} = \frac{\sum d_i}{n} = \frac{-3 + 1 - 1 -2 +1 -1 +0 -1 -2 +0 -1 -2 -1 +0 -1 -1}{16} = -0.875
$$

$$
s_d = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (d_i - \bar{d})^2}{n-1}}  \approx 1.125
$$

Paired t-test statistic:

$$
t = \frac{\bar{d}}{s_d / \sqrt{n}}
$$

$$
t = \frac{-0.875}{1.125 / \sqrt{16}} \approx -3.89
$$

Degrees of freedom: $df = n - 1 = 15$.

For $\alpha = 0.05$, two-tailed $t_{0.025, 15} \approx 2.131$.

Since $|t| = 3.89 > 2.131$, we **reject** $H_0$. There is **sufficient evidence** to conclude that the mean reaction times for the two stimuli are significantly different.
