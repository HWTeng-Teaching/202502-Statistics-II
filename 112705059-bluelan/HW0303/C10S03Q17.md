# Solution
### (a) 

To check if the variances are equal, we see:

$$\frac{s_1^2}{s_2^2} = \frac{2.78095}{0.17143} \approx 16.22$$

Since the ratio to the critical value is much greater than 3, we conclude that the variances are **not** equal.

### (b)

$H_0: \mu_1 - \mu_2 = 0$

$H_a: \mu_1 - \mu_2 \neq 0$

Since the variances are unequal, we use Welchâ€™s \( t \)-test:

$$
t = \frac{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2}{\sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}} 
= \frac{3.73 - 4.80}{\sqrt{\frac{2.78095}{15} + \frac{0.17143}{15}}}
\approx -2.41
$$

$$
df = \frac{\left(\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2} \right)^2}{\frac{\left(\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} \right)^2}{n_1 - 1} + \frac{\left(\frac{s_2^2}{n_2} \right)^2}{n_2 - 1}}
\approx 14
$$

For a two-tailed test at $\alpha = 0.05$, the critical value for $t_{0.025, 14}$ is **2.145**.

Since |t| = 2.41 > 2.145 , we reject $H_0$. 

Thus, there is **significant evidence** that the mean number of uncontaminated eggplants differs between the two disinfectants.
