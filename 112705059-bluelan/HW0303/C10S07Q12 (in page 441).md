## Solution

- **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** (μ₁ = μ₂).
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** (μ₁ ≠ μ₂).

For each person, calculate the difference in reaction times (D = Stimulus 1 - Stimulus 2):

| Person | Stimulus 1 | Stimulus 2 | Difference (D) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1    | 3    | 4    | -1    |
| 2    | 1    | 2    | -1    |
| 3    | 1    | 3    | -2    |
| 4    | 2    | 1    | 1    |
| 5    | 1    | 2    | -1    |
| 6    | 2    | 3    | -1    |
| 7    | 3    | 3    | 0    |
| 8    | 2    | 3    | -1    |

- **Mean of Differences (D̄):**

$$D̄ = \frac{\sum D}{n} = \frac{-1 -1 -2 +1 -1 -1 +0 -1}{8} = \frac{-6}{8} = -0.75$$

- **Standard Deviation of Differences (s_D):**

$$s_D = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (D - D̄)^2}{n-1}}$$

$$
s_D = \sqrt{\frac{5.5}{7}} \approx \sqrt{0.7857} \approx 0.886
$$

$$
t = \frac{D̄}{s_D / \sqrt{n}} = \frac{-0.75}{0.886 / \sqrt{8}} \approx \frac{-0.75}{0.313} \approx -2.396
$$

For a two-tailed test with α = 0.05 and degrees of freedom (df) = n - 1 = 7, the critical t-value from the t-distribution table is approximately ±2.365.

Since | -2.396 | > 2.365, we reject the null hypothesis.

There is sufficient evidence at the 0.05 significance level to conclude that there is a significant difference in mean reaction times between the two stimuli.
