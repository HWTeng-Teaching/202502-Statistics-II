## Solution

### (a)

- **Null Hypothesis**: $H_0: \mu_A = \mu_B$ (No difference in average density)
- **Alternative Hypothesis**: $H_A: \mu_A \neq \mu_B$ (Densities are different)
- **Significance Level**: $\alpha = 0.05$

The density differences for each location:

| Location | Batter A | Batter B | Difference (d)) |
|----------|---------|---------|----------------|
| 1        | 0.135   | 0.129   | 0.006          |
| 2        | 0.102   | 0.120   | -0.018         |
| 3        | 0.098   | 0.112   | -0.014         |
| 4        | 0.141   | 0.152   | -0.011         |
| 5        | 0.131   | 0.135   | -0.004         |
| 6        | 0.144   | 0.163   | -0.019         |

1. Compute the mean difference:

$$
\bar{d} = \frac{\sum d_i}{n} = \frac{0.006 + (-0.018) + (-0.014) + (-0.011) + (-0.004) + (-0.019)}{6} = -0.010
$$

2. Compute the standard deviation of differences:

$$
s_d = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (d_i - \bar{d})^2}{n - 1}} \approx 0.011
$$

3. Compute the test statistic:

$$
t = \frac{\bar{d}}{s_d / \sqrt{n}}
$$

$$
t = \frac{-0.010}{0.011 / \sqrt{6}} \approx -2.23
$$

4. Determine critical value from t-table at $df = 5$, $\alpha = 0.05$:

$$
t_{0.025, 5} = 2.571
$$

5. Compare test statistic:

Since $|t| = 2.23 < 2.571$, we **fail to reject $H_0$**. There is **insufficient evidence** to conclude a difference in density.

### (b) 95% Confidence Interval for Mean Difference

$$
\bar{d} \pm t_{\alpha/2} \times \frac{s_d}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

$$
-0.010 \pm 2.571 \times \frac{0.011}{\sqrt{6}}
$$

$$
-0.010 \pm 0.0116
$$

$$
(-0.0216, 0.0016)
$$

Since the interval includes 0, there is **no significant difference** in density.
