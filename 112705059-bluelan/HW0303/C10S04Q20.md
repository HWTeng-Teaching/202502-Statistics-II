## Solution

We perform a **paired t-test** to determine if using imagery significantly improves recall.

- **Null Hypothesis**:  $H_0: \mu_d = 0$ (No difference in recall with imagery)
- **Alternative Hypothesis**: $H_a: \mu_d > 0$ (Imagery improves recall)

Where $d = \text{With Imagery} - \text{Without Imagery}$.

#### Differences \( d \)
For each student, we calculate:

$$
d_i = X_{\text{With Imagery}, i} - X_{\text{Without Imagery}, i}
$$

The computed differences are:

$$
(15, 15, 15, 9, 16, 8, 12, 8, 10, 12, 9, 4, 10, 4, 17, 13, 4, 7, 7, 10)
$$

Mean of the differences:

$$
\bar{d} = \frac{\sum d_i}{n} = \frac{15 + 15 + 15 + \dots + 10}{20} = 10.2
$$

Standard deviation:

$$
s_d = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (d_i - \bar{d})^2}{n-1}}
$$

$$
s_d \approx 4.2
$$

The paired **t-test statistic** is:

$$
t = \frac{\bar{d}}{s_d / \sqrt{n}}
$$

$$
t = \frac{10.2}{4.2 / \sqrt{20}} = \frac{10.2}{0.94} \approx 10.85
$$

Degrees of freedom:

$$
df = n - 1 = 19
$$

For a **one-tailed** test at $\alpha = 0.05$, the critical value $t_{0.05,19} \approx 1.729$.

Since **$t = 10.85 > 1.729$**, we **reject$H_0$**. There is strong evidence that using imagery improves recall.
