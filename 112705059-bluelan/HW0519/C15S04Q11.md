### (a)

**Step 1: Calculate the differences and assign ranks**  

| Pair | A - B | Rank (ignoring zero) |
|:----:|:-----:|:-------------------:|
|   1  |  -4   |         6           |
|   2  |   2   |         3.5         |
|   3  |  -2   |         3.5         |
|   4  |  -5   |         7           |
|   5  |  -3   |         5           |
|   6  |   0   |      (excluded)     |
|   7  |   1   |         1.5         |
|   8  |   1   |         1.5         |
|   9  |  -6   |         8           |

- **Note**: The zero difference (Pair 6) is excluded from ranking. Tied values (e.g., Pairs 2 and 3, Pairs 7 and 8) receive averaged ranks.  

**Step 2: Compute \( T^+ \) and \( T^- \)**  
- \( T^+ \): Sum of ranks for positive differences (Pairs 2, 7, 8):  
  \( 3.5 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6.5 \)  
- \( T^- \): Sum of ranks for negative differences (Pairs 1, 3, 4, 5, 9):  
  \( 6 + 3.5 + 7 + 5 + 8 = 29.5 \)  

**Step 3: Hypothesis Testing**  
1. **Hypotheses**:  
   - \( H_0 \): Median difference \( = 0 \) (no difference between machines).  
   - \( H_a \): Median difference \( \neq 0 \) (machines differ).  

2. **Significance Level**: \( \alpha = 0.05 \).  

3. **Test Statistic**:  
   - \( T = \min(T^+, T^-) = \min(6.5, 29.5) = 6.5 \).  
   - **Effective sample size**: \( n = 8 \) (after excluding Pair 6).  

4. **Critical Value**:  
   - From the Wilcoxon signed-rank table for \( n = 8 \) and two-tailed \( \alpha = 0.05 \), the critical value is \( 4 \).  

5. **Decision**:  
   - Since \( T = 6.5 > 4 \), **fail to reject \( H_0 \)**.  

**Conclusion**: There is **insufficient evidence** to conclude that the monthly breakdown rates differ between the two machines at the 5% significance level.

### (b) 
1. **Operational Variability**:  
   - Machines may be subjected to **different workloads** or **operating conditions** each month (e.g., varying production demands).  

2. **Environmental Factors**:  
   - Changes in **temperature**, **humidity**, or **dust levels** could affect the machines differently.  

3. **Maintenance or Usage Differences**:  
   - Machines might be **serviced at different intervals** or operated by **different personnel**, leading to inconsistent wear and tear.  

4. **Random Variability**:  
   - Even under identical conditions, mechanical systems can exhibit **natural fluctuations** in performance due to minor, uncontrollable factors.
