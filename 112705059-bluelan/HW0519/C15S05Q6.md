### Kruskal-Wallis Test Solution

**Step 1: Organize the Data and Assign Ranks**

The response times (in minutes) for four different instructional lengths (0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 hours) were ranked across all groups:

| 0.5 hr | 1 hr  | 1.5 hr | 2 hr |
|:------:|:-----:|:------:|:----:|
|   13   |  16   |   2    |   2  |
|   20   |  10   |  7.5   |  10  |
|   16   |   5   |   10   |   5  |
|   19   |  13   |   13   |   5  |
|   18   |  16   |  7.5   |   2  |

**Step 2: Calculate Rank Sums (T_i) for Each Group**
- T₁ (0.5 hr): 13 + 20 + 16 + 19 + 18 = **86.5**
- T₂ (1 hr): 16 + 10 + 5 + 13 + 16 = **61**
- T₃ (1.5 hr): 2 + 7.5 + 10 + 13 + 7.5 = **41.5**
- T₄ (2 hr): 2 + 10 + 5 + 5 + 2 = **26**

**Step 3: State the Hypotheses**
- *H₀*: The distributions of response times are identical for all four instructional lengths.
- *Hₐ*: At least one instructional length has a different distribution of response times.

**Step 4: Compute the Test Statistic**
Using the Kruskal-Wallis formula:
\[
H = \frac{12}{n(n+1)} \sum_{i=1}^k \frac{T_i^2}{n_i} - 3(n+1)
\]
Where:
- \( n = 20 \) (total observations)
- \( k = 4 \) (groups)
- Each \( n_i = 5 \) (equal group sizes)

\[
H^* = \frac{12}{20 \times 21} \left( \frac{86.5^2}{5} + \frac{61^2}{5} + \frac{41.5^2}{5} + \frac{26^2}{5} \right) - 3 \times 21 \approx 14.723
\]

**Step 5: Determine the Critical Value**
- Degrees of freedom: \( k - 1 = 3 \)
- For \( \alpha = 0.01 \), \( \chi^2_{3, 0.01} = 11.3449 \)

**Step 6: Make the Decision**
- Since \( H^* = 14.723 > 11.3449 \), we **reject H₀**.

**Conclusion**: There is **strong evidence** (\( p < 0.01 \)) that at least one instructional length leads to significantly different response times. Post-hoc pairwise comparisons (e.g., Dunn’s test) would identify which specific groups differ.
