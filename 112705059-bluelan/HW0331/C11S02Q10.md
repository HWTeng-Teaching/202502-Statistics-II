## Solution
### a
P-value = 0.0251, which is smaller than $\alpha = 0.05$.
So, we can conclude that there is a significant difference in mean assembly times.

### d
The data generally meet the normality assumption for ANOVA. The variances are reasonably homogeneous, with the largest variance (21.7) being only 2.33 times greater than the smallest (9.33), below the common 431 threshold. The ranges (A: 57–64, B: 52–58, C: 58–71) show no extreme outliers or obvious skewness.
