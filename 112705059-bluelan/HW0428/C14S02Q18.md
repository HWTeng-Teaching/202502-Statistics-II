### (a.)

**Hypotheses:**
- Null hypothesis (H₀): p₁ = p₂ = p₃ = 1/3  
  (Equal preference for all three entrances)
- Alternative hypothesis (Hₐ): At least one pᵢ differs from 1/3  
  (Preference difference exists among entrances)

**Significance level:** α = 0.05

**Test Statistic:**  
Pearson's chi-squared statistic:  
χ² = Σ[(Oᵢ - Eᵢ)²/Eᵢ] ~ χ²ₖ₋₁  
where k = number of categories (3 entrances)

**Calculations:**
1. Expected counts (Eᵢ) under H₀:  
   Total observations = 83 + 61 + 56 = 200  
   Eᵢ = 200 × (1/3) ≈ 66.667 for each entrance

2. Observed chi-squared statistic:  
   χ²* = (83-66.667)²/66.667 + (61-66.667)²/66.667 + (56-66.667)²/66.667  
   = 4.083 + 0.480 + 1.627 ≈ 6.190

**Decision Rule:**  
Reject H₀ if χ²* > χ²₀.₀₅,₂ = 5.99147

**Conclusion:**  
Since 6.190 > 5.99147, we reject the null hypothesis. There is statistically significant evidence (at α=0.05) that customers show different preferences among the three entrances.

### (b.)

For the entrance with 83 preferences (sample proportion p̂ = 83/200 = 0.415):

CI = p̂ ± z₀.₀₂₅ × √[p̂(1-p̂)/n]  
= 0.415 ± 1.96 × √[0.415×0.585/200]  
= 0.415 ± 0.068  
= (0.347, 0.483)

Interpretation: We are 95% confident that the true preference proportion for this entrance lies between 34.7% and 48.3%.
