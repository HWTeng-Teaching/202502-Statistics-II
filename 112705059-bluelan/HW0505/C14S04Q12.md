### Chi-Square Test of Independence: Family Size vs. Residence Type

#### **Expected Frequencies Table**
| Family Size | Apartment | Duplex | Single Residence | Row Total |
|-------------|-----------|--------|------------------|-----------|
| 1           | 9.67      | 9.67   | 9.67             | 29        |
| 2           | 11.00     | 11.00  | 11.00            | 33        |
| 3           | 11.33     | 11.33  | 11.33            | 34        |
| 4+          | 8.00      | 8.00   | 8.00             | 24        |
| **Column Total** | **40** | **40** | **40**           | **120**   |

*Expected counts calculated as: (Row Total × Column Total)/Grand Total*

#### **Hypothesis Test**
1. **Hypotheses**:
   - H₀: Family size is independent of residence type
   - Hₐ: Family size depends on residence type

2. **Significance Level**: α = 0.01

3. **Test Statistic**:
   χ² = Σ[(Observed - Expected)²/Expected] ~ χ² with df = (4-1)(3-1) = 6

4. **Calculated Test Statistic**:
   χ²* = (8-9.67)²/9.67 + (20-9.67)²/9.67 + ... + (16-8)²/8 ≈ 36.49

5. **Critical Value**:
   χ²(0.01, 6) = 16.81

6. **Decision**:
   Since 36.49 > 16.81, we reject H₀.

#### **Conclusion**
There is significant evidence (p < 0.01) that family size distributions differ across residence types:
