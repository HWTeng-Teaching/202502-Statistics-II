### Solution

**Observed vs. Expected Frequencies:**

| Severity     | Small (Expected) | Medium (Expected) | Large (Expected) |
|--------------|------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Fatal        | 67 (61.43)       | 26 (28.04)        | 16 (19.53)       |
| Not Fatal    | 128 (133.57)     | 63 (60.96)        | 46 (42.47)       |

**Test Parameters:**
- Rows (r) = 2  
- Columns (c) = 3  
- Degrees of freedom = (r-1)(c-1) = 2  

**Hypotheses:**
- Null (H₀): Fatal accident frequency is independent of automobile size  
- Alternative (Hₐ): Fatal accident frequency depends on automobile size  

**Test Execution:**
1. Significance level: α = 0.05  
2. Test statistic: χ² = Σ[(O-E)²/E] ~ χ²(2)  
3. Calculated statistic:  
   χ²* = (67-61.43)²/61.43 + (26-28.04)²/28.04 + (16-19.53)²/19.53  
        + (128-133.57)²/133.57 + (63-60.96)²/60.96 + (46-42.47)²/42.47 ≈ 1.885  

**Decision Rule:**
- Critical value: χ²(0.05;2) = 5.991  
- Rejection region: χ² > 5.991  

**Conclusion:**
The calculated χ² statistic (1.885) does not exceed the critical value (5.991), therefore we fail to reject H₀. The data suggests no statistically significant association between automobile size and fatal accident frequency at the 0.05 significance level.
