Here's a rewritten version of your solution with improved clarity and flow:

### Chi-Square Test of Independence Solution

#### Expected Frequencies Table
| Education Level       | Married (Expected) | Not Married (Expected) | Row Total |
|-----------------------|--------------------|------------------------|-----------|
| Bachelors or higher   | 166                | 134                    | 300       |
| Some college          | 166                | 134                    | 300       |
| High school or less   | 166                | 134                    | 300       |
| **Column Total**      | **498**            | **402**                | **900**   |

*Calculations*:  
Expected frequency = (Row Total × Column Total) / Grand Total  
Example: (300 × 498)/900 = 166

#### Hypothesis Test
1. **Hypotheses**:
   - H₀: Marriage status is independent of education level
   - Hₐ: Marriage status depends on education level

2. **Significance Level**: α = 0.01

3. **Test Statistic**:
   χ² = Σ[(Oᵢⱼ - Eᵢⱼ)²/Eᵢⱼ] ~ χ² with df = (3-1)(2-1) = 2

4. **Calculated Test Statistic**:
   χ²* = (187-166)²/166 + (162-166)²/166 + (149-166)²/166  
        + (113-134)²/134 + (138-134)²/134 + (151-134)²/134  
        ≈ 10.06

5. **Critical Value**:
   χ²(0.01, 2) = 9.210

6. **Decision**:
   Since 10.06 > 9.210, we reject H₀.

7. **Conclusion**:
   There is significant evidence (at α = 0.01) that marriage rates vary by education level.
