### Solution
#### (a)  

$\bar{x} = 20.3, \quad s = 5.0, \quad n = 21$  
 
$H_0: \mu = 25$     
$H_a: \mu < 25$  
$\alpha = 0.05$  

$t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{s/ \sqrt{n}} = \frac{20.3 - 25}{5 / \sqrt{21}} \approx -4.308$

$t_{20;0.05} = -1.725$  

Since $t^* = -4.3076 < -1.725$, reject $H_0$.  

**Conclusion:** There is enough evidence to say the true pretreatment mean is less than 25.

#### (b)  
$\quad \bar{x} = 26.6 \quad  \quad s = 7.4 \quad  \quad n = 21$  
$\quad$ The test statistic and its distribution  

$$
t_{\text{STAT}} = \frac{\bar{x} - 25}{s / \sqrt{n}} \sim t_{20}
$$

$$
P\left[-t_{\alpha/2} < \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{s / \sqrt{n}} < t_{\alpha/2} \right] = 1 - \alpha
$$

$$
P\left[\bar{X} - t_{\alpha/2} \cdot \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} < \mu < \bar{X} + t_{\alpha/2} \cdot \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} \right] = 1 - \alpha
$$

$\quad$ Therefore, the 95% confidence interval for the true posttreatment mean($\mu$) is 

$$
P\left[\bar{X} - t_{0.05/2} \cdot \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} < \mu < \bar{X} + t_{0.05/2} \cdot \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} \right] = 0.95
$$

$$
\mu \in \bar{X} \pm t_{0.05/2} \cdot \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} \quad  
$$

$$
\mu \in 26.6 \pm t_{0.025} \cdot \frac{7.4}{\sqrt{21}}
$$

$$
\mu \in 26.6 \pm 2.086 \cdot \frac{7.4}{\sqrt{21}}
$$

$$
\mu \in (23.2315,29.9685)
$$

#### (c) 
By analyzing the means:  
- Pretreatment: $20.3$  
- Posttreatment: $26.6$  
- Follow-up: $27.7$  

The means increase from pretreatment to posttreatment and further slightly increase at follow-up. Since the standard deviations are relatively moderate, this suggests that the treatment **likely has a positive effect** on self-esteem.  

Remark: Without being introduced to a formal test, we cannot determine if these differences are statistically significant.
