### Solution
#### (a)  

$\bar{x} = 20.3, \quad s = 5.0, \quad n = 21$  
 
$H_0: \mu = 25$     
$H_a: \mu < 25$  
$\alpha = 0.05$  

$t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{s/ \sqrt{n}} = \frac{20.3 - 25}{5 / \sqrt{21}} \approx -4.308$

$t_{20;0.05} = -1.725$  

Since $t^* = -4.3076 < -1.725$, reject $H_0$.  

**Conclusion:** There is enough evidence to say the true pretreatment mean is less than 25.

#### (b)  
$CI = \bar{x} \pm t_{20;0.025} \times \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$
$= 26.6 \pm 2.086 \times \frac{7.4}{\sqrt{21}}$
$=(23.232, 29.968)$

#### (c) 
Self-esteem scores increased from **20.3 (pretreatment) → 26.6 (posttreatment) → 27.7 (follow-up)**, suggesting a **likely positive effect** of the treatment.  

**Note:** Statistical significance has not been formally tested.
