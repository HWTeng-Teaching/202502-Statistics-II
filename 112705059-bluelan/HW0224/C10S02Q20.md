## Question
<img width="429" alt="截圖 2024-03-09 下午4 59 35" src="https://github.com/HWTeng-Course/202402-Statistics/assets/162074988/9646da7e-6769-4aeb-9b81-e9ba928df858">

$H_0$: $\mu = 74$  
$H_a$: $\mu \neq 74$  

$\alpha = 0.05$  
$n = 25$  
$\bar{x} = 69.7$  
$s = 16$  
$\mu_0 = 74$  

Test statistic:  

$$
t^* = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{s / \sqrt{n}} = \frac{69.7 - 74}{16 / \sqrt{25}} = -1.34375
$$

Critical value:  

$$
t_{24;0.025} = \pm 2.064
$$

Since $t^* = -1.34375$ does not fall within the rejection region ($t < -2.064$ or $t > 2.064$), we fail to reject $H_0$.  

**Conclusion:**  
There is not enough statistical evidence to conclude that the average CBF for stroke patients is significantly different from that of healthy individuals.
