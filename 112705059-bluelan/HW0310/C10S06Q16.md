## Solution

- **Chemistry**: $\overline{x} = 784$, s = 114, n = 15  
- **Physics**: $\overline{x} = 758\$, s = 103, n = 15  

We use the **F-test for equality of variances** to find the approximate p-value.

#### **Hypotheses**
- **Null Hypothesis $H_0$**: Variances are equal $ﾏダ1^2 = ﾏダ2^2$.  
- **Alternative Hypothesis $H_1$**: Variances are not equal $ﾏダ1^2 \neq ﾏダ2^2$ (two-tailed test).  

---

#### **Steps**
1. **Calculate Sample Variances**:  
   - Chemistry: $s_1^2 = 114^2 = 12,996$
   - Physics: $s_2^2 = 103^2 = 10,609$

2. **Compute F-statistic**:  
   
   $$F = \frac{\text{Larger Variance}}{\text{Smaller Variance}} = \frac{12,996}{10,609} \approx 1.225$$

3. **Degrees of Freedom**:  
   - Numerator $df_1$ = $n_1 - 1 = 14$ (Chemistry)  
   - Denominator $df_2$ = $n_2 - 1 = 14$ (Physics)  

4. **Determine p-value**:  
   - Use the F-distribution with $df_1 = 14$, $df_2 = 14$.  
   - For F = 1.225, the **one-tailed p-value** (right-tail) is approximately **0.35**.  
   - Since this is a two-tailed test, double the one-tailed \(p\)-value:  
     $$p\text{-value} \approx 0.35 \times 2 = 0.70$$

---

#### **Conclusion**
- The approximate **p-value is 0.70**, which is **much larger than $\alpha = 0.05$**.  
- **Fail to reject $H_0$**: There is insufficient evidence to conclude that the variances differ.
