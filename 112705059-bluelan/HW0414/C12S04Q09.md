## Solition
### (a)  
An \( R^2 \) value of **0.027** indicates that only **2.7%** of the variation in price is explained by screen size.  
**Conclusion**: The relationship between screen size and price is **very weak**.

###  (b)  
#### **Normal Probability Plot**  
- The points approximately follow a straight line.  
- **Conclusion**: The normality assumption is **reasonable** (no clear violation).  

#### **Residuals vs. Fitted Plot**  
- No discernible pattern; residuals are evenly dispersed around zero.  
- **Conclusion**: The **equal variance (homoscedasticity)** assumption holds.  

**Final Note**: Both diagnostic plots support the validity of the regression assumptions.

NO clear linear trend.
The assumption of linearity is violated.
