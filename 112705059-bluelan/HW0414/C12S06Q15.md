**Part (a): Correlation Coefficient Calculation**

We define:
- x = body temperature (°F)
- y = heart rate (bpm)
- n = 12 (sample size)

Key calculations:
1. Sum of cross-products:
   $$S_{xy} = \sum xy - \frac{\sum x \sum y}{n} = 88140.6 - \frac{1180.3 \times 896}{12} = 11.5333$$

2. Sum of squares for x:
   $$S_{xx} = \sum x^2 - \frac{(\sum x)^2}{n} = 116103.03 - \frac{1180.3^2}{12} = 10.6892$$

3. Sum of squares for y:
   $$S_{yy} = \sum y^2 - \frac{(\sum y)^2}{n} = 67312 - \frac{896^2}{12} = 410.6667$$

4. Pearson correlation coefficient:
   $$r = \frac{S_{xy}}{\sqrt{S_{xx}S_{yy}}} = \frac{11.5333}{\sqrt{10.6892 \times 410.6667}} = 0.1741$$

**Part (b): Hypothesis Testing**

We conduct a two-tailed test with α = 0.05:
- Null hypothesis (H₀): ρ = 0 (no correlation)
- Alternative hypothesis (Hₐ): ρ ≠ 0 (correlation exists)

Test statistic calculation:
$$t = r \sqrt{\frac{n-2}{1-r^2}} = 0.1741 \sqrt{\frac{10}{1-0.0303}} = 0.5591$$

Critical value:
$$t_{critical} = t_{10,0.025} = 2.228$$

**Conclusion:**
Since |t| = 0.5591 < 2.228, we fail to reject H₀ (p > 0.05). There is insufficient evidence to conclude a statistically significant correlation between body temperature and heart rate in this dataset (r = 0.174).
