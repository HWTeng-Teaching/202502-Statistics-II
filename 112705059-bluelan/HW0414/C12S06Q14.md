Hereâ€™s a refined version of your answer with improved clarity and academic tone:

---

### **Part (a): Relationship Between Calories and Total Fat**  
**Observation:**  
Yes, there appears to be a **positive relationship** between calories and total fat. The data suggests that higher calorie counts are associated with higher total fat content.  

---

### **Part (b): Correlation Analysis**  
**Variables:**  
- **Independent Variable (x):** Total fat (g)  
- **Dependent Variable (y):** Calories  

**Calculations:**  
The **correlation coefficient (r)** was computed as:  
\[
r = 0.844
\]  

**Interpretation:**  
- The value \( r = 0.844 \) indicates a **strong positive linear relationship** between total fat and calories.  
- As \( r \) approaches 1, the linear association becomes more pronounced.  

**Conclusion:**  
The high correlation coefficient confirms that total fat content is a significant predictor of calorie content in the observed data.
