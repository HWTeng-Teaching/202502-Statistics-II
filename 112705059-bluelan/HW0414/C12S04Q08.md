## Solution
### a.
The random error ε must follow a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a constant variance (σ²), independent of the predictor variable x.

### b.
The best estimate of σ² is the Mean Square Error (MSE), calculated as:
σ^2=MSE=58.05

### c.
Normality: The normal probability plot indicates slight deviations in the tails, but the overall distribution is approximately normal.

Residuals: The residual plot shows one potential outlier, but no significant patterns (e.g., curvature or heteroscedasticity) are present.

Conclusion: The regression assumptions are reasonably satisfied, and the model is appropriate for the data.
