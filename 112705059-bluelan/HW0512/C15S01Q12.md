### Solution

#### **A:**

**Hypotheses:**
- H₀: Identical population distributions above and below town  
- Hₐ: Oxygen levels are systematically higher above town (right-shifted distribution)

**Test Procedure:**
1. Combined ranking of all observations (ties receive average ranks)
2. Calculated rank sums:
   - Above town (Sample 1): T₁ = 34  
   - Below town (Sample 2): T₂ = 21 (using T₂ = n₁(n₁+n₂+1) - T₁)

**Test Statistic:**
- T* = min(T₁, T₂) = 21  
- Critical value (α=0.05, n₁=n₂=5): T₀.₀₅ = 19

**Conclusion:**
Since 21 > 19, we fail to reject H₀ (p > 0.05). The data don't provide sufficient evidence to conclude that oxygen levels are systematically higher above the town.

#### **B:**

**Descriptive Statistics:**
| Location   | Mean | Variance | Sample Size |
|------------|------|----------|-------------|
| Above town | 5.00 | 0.025    | 5           |
| Below town | 4.86 | 0.013    | 5           |

**Variance Check:**
- Variance ratio = 0.025/0.013 ≈ 1.92 (< 3) → Equal variance assumption holds

**Pooled Variance:**
sₚ² = [(4×0.025) + (4×0.013)]/8 = 0.019

**Hypotheses:**
- H₀: μ₁ - μ₂ = 0  
- Hₐ: μ₁ - μ₂ > 0 (one-tailed)

**Test Results:**
- t = (5.00 - 4.86)/√[0.019(1/5 + 1/5)] ≈ 1.606  
- Critical value (df=8, α=0.05): t₀.₀₅ = 1.860

**Conclusion:**
Since 1.606 < 1.860, we fail to reject H₀ (p > 0.05). The parametric test agrees with the nonparametric result - no significant evidence of higher oxygen levels above town.
