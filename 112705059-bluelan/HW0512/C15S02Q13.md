### **Solution**

#### **(a)**

**1. Hypotheses:**
- **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$):**  
  The recovery rates for the two drugs are equal.  
  ($P(\text{Drug A > Drug B}) = 0.5$)  

- **Alternative Hypothesis ($H_a$):**  
  The recovery rates are not equal.  
  ($P(\text{Drug A > Drug B}) \neq 0.5$)  

**2. Significance Level:**  
  $\alpha = 0.10$ (two-tailed test)  

**3. Test Statistic:**  
  - **Number of positive signs ($+$):** $x = 2$ (Drug A > Drug B)  
  - **Number of negative signs ($-$):** $8$ (Drug B > Drug A)  
  - **Total non-tied pairs ($n$):** $10$  

**4. Calculation of $p$-value:**  
  Under $H_0$, $X \sim \text{Binomial}(n=10, p=0.5)$.  
  The $p$-value for a two-tailed test is:  
  $$
  p\text{-value} = 2 \times P(X \leq 2) = 2 \times (P(X=0) + P(X=1) + P(X=2))  
  $$  
  Using binomial probabilities:  
  $$
  p\text{-value} = 2 \times (0.001 + 0.010 + 0.044) = 2 \times 0.055 = 0.11  
  $$  

**5. Decision:**  
  Since $p\text{-value} = 0.11 > \alpha = 0.10$, **we fail to reject $H_0$**.  

**6. Conclusion:**  
  There is **insufficient evidence** to conclude that one drug has a significantly higher recovery rate than the other at the $10\%$ significance level.

#### **(b) **  

If the **data are not normally distributed**, the **Student’s $t$-test** may produce **misleading results** because:  

1. **Assumption Violation:**  
   The $t$-test assumes that the **differences between pairs are normally distributed**.  
   - If the distribution is **skewed or has outliers**, the $t$-test can be **unreliable**.  

2. **Non-Robustness to Non-Normality:**  
   - The $t$-test is **sensitive to deviations from normality**, especially with **small sample sizes** ($n < 30$).  
   - In such cases, **non-parametric tests (e.g., Sign Test, Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test)** are more appropriate because they do not require normality.  

3. **Sign Test as a Robust Alternative:**  
   - The **Sign Test** makes **no distributional assumptions** and is valid for **any continuous data**.  
   - It is **less powerful** than the $t$-test when normality holds but **more reliable** when normality is violated.  

**Conclusion:**  
Since the normality assumption may not hold here, the **Sign Test** is a better choice than the **Student’s $t$-test** for comparing the two drugs.
