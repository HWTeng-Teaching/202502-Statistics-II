### **Solution**

#### **(a)**

**1. Hypotheses Formulation:**
- **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** The median difference between paired observations is zero (p = 0.5)
- **Alternative Hypothesis (Hₐ):** The median difference is not zero (p ≠ 0.5)

**2. Significance Level:**
- α = 0.10 (two-tailed test)

**3. Test Statistic Calculation:**
- Differences and their ranks:
  
  | Pair | Difference | Absolute Diff | Rank |
  |------|------------|---------------|------|
  | 1    | 0.1        | 0.1           | 1.5  |
  | 2    | 0.5        | 0.5           | 6    |
  | 3    | 0.3        | 0.3           | 4    |
  | 4    | -0.1       | 0.1           | 1.5  |
  | 5    | 0.5        | 0.5           | 6    |
  | 6    | 0.2        | 0.2           | 3    |
  | 7    | 0.5        | 0.5           | 6    |

- Sum of ranks:
  - Positive ranks (T⁺) = 1.5 + 6 + 4 + 6 + 3 + 6 = 26.5
  - Negative ranks (T⁻) = 1.5
- Test statistic: T = min(T⁺, T⁻) = 1.5

**4. Decision Rule:**
- For n=7 at α=0.10, the critical value is 4
- Rejection region: T ≤ 4

**5. Conclusion:**
- Since T = 1.5 ≤ 4, we reject H₀
- There is statistically significant evidence of a difference between the two populations at the 10% significance level

#### **(b)**

The results differ from the previous Sign Test analysis (which failed to reject H₀) because:

1. **Information Utilization:**
   - The Sign Test only considers the direction of differences (+/-)
   - The Wilcoxon test incorporates both direction and magnitude through ranking

2. **Statistical Power:**
   - The Wilcoxon test is more sensitive to detect differences as it uses more information
   - For small samples, it typically has greater power than the Sign Test

3. **Practical Implications:**
   - When the Sign Test is inconclusive, the Wilcoxon test can provide more definitive results
   - The Wilcoxon test is particularly useful when the distribution is symmetric but not necessarily normal
