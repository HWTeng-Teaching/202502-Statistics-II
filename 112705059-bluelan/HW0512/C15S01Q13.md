### Solution

#### **Hypotheses**
- **H₀**: The distributions of eye-movement rates are identical for deaf and hearing children
- **Hₐ**: The distributions differ between groups (two-tailed test)

#### **Test Setup**
- Sample sizes: n₁(hearing) = 9, n₂(deaf) = 9
- Rank sums:
  - Hearing children: T₁ = 45
  - Deaf children: T₂ = 126 (calculated as n₁(n₁+n₂+1) - T₁ = 9×19 - 45)

#### **Test Statistic**
- T* = min(T₁, T₂) = min(45, 126) = 45

#### **Decision Rule**
- Critical value (α=0.05, two-tailed, n₁=n₂=9): T₀.₀₂₅ = 62
- Rejection criterion: Reject H₀ if T* ≤ 62

#### **Conclusion**
Since T* = 45 ≤ 62, we reject H₀ at the 0.05 significance level. There is statistically significant evidence that hearing children tend to have lower eye-movement rates than deaf children (p < 0.05).
