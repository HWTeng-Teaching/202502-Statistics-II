Here's the improved solution with proper formatting and clearer explanations:

### Solution

#### (a) Friedman Test Analysis

**Step 1: Rank the Data Within Each Block (Field)**

| Field | Variety 1 | Variety 2 | Variety 3 | Variety 4 | Variety 5 |
|:-----:|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|
|  B1   |     4     |     1     |     5     |     3     |     2     |
|  B2   |     2     |     3     |     4     |     5     |     1     |
|  B3   |     3     |     2     |     4     |     5     |     1     |
|  B4   |     3     |     2     |     4     |     5     |     1     |
|  B5   |     3     |     2     |     4     |     5     |     1     |
|  B6   |     3     |     2     |     5     |     4     |     1     |

**Step 2: Calculate Rank Sums (Tj) for Each Variety**
- T₁ = 4+2+3+3+3+3 = 18
- T₂ = 1+3+2+2+2+2 = 12
- T₃ = 5+4+4+4+4+5 = 26
- T₄ = 3+5+5+5+5+4 = 27
- T₅ = 2+1+1+1+1+1 = 7

**Step 3: State the Hypotheses**
- H₀: All wheat varieties have identical yield distributions
- Hₐ: At least one variety differs in yield distribution

**Step 4: Compute the Test Statistic**
\[
F_r = \frac{12}{bk(k+1)}\sum T_j^2 - 3b(k+1)
\]
Where:
- b = 6 (blocks/fields)
- k = 5 (treatments/varieties)

\[
F_r^* = \frac{12}{6×5×6}(18^2+12^2+26^2+27^2+7^2) - 3×6×6 = 38.133
\]

**Step 5: Make the Decision**
- Critical value: χ²₄,0.05 = 9.4877
- Since 38.133 > 9.4877, we reject H₀

**Conclusion:** There is significant evidence (p < 0.05) of yield differences among the wheat varieties.

#### (b) ANOVA Comparison

**ANOVA Results:**
- F-statistic = 18.61
- Critical F-value (F₄,₂₀,0.05) = 2.87
- Since 18.61 > 2.87, we reject H₀

**Agreement Between Tests:**
Both Friedman and ANOVA tests:
1. Reach the same conclusion (reject H₀)
2. Indicate significant yield differences
3. Show that results are robust to distributional assumptions
