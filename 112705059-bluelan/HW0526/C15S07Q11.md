### Solution: Spearman's Rank Correlation Analysis

#### (a) Calculating Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient

**Ranked Data:**
| Observation | Rank A (x) | Rank B (y) |
|-------------|------------|------------|
|      1      |     7.5    |     3      |
|      2      |     4      |     7      |
|      3      |     3      |     12     |
|      4      |     12     |     1      |
|      5      |     10     |     8      |
|      6      |     7.5    |     11     |
|      7      |     6      |     4      |
|      8      |     11     |     2      |
|      9      |     1      |     10     |
|     10      |     5      |     9      |
|     11      |     9      |    5.5     |
|     12      |     2      |    5.5     |

**Calculations:**
1. Sum of ranks:
   - Σx = 78
   - Σy = 78

2. Sum of products:
   - Σxy = 422.5

3. Sum of squared ranks:
   - Σx² = 649.5
   - Σy² = 649.5

4. Covariance term:
   - Sxy = Σxy - (Σx)(Σy)/n = 422.5 - (78×78)/12 = -84.5

5. Variance terms:
   - Sxx = Σx² - (Σx)²/n = 649.5 - (78)²/12 = 142.5
   - Syy = Σy² - (Σy)²/n = 649.5 - (78)²/12 = 142.5

6. Spearman's coefficient:
   rₛ = Sxy/√(Sxx×Syy) = -84.5/√(142.5×142.5) ≈ -0.593


#### (b) Hypothesis Testing

**1. Hypotheses:**
- H₀: ρ = 0 (no rank correlation)
- Hₐ: ρ < 0 (negative rank correlation)

**2. Significance Level:**
- α = 0.05

**3. Test Statistic:**
- rₛ,STAT follows Spearman's rank correlation distribution
- Critical values from Table 9 (n=12)

**4. Observed Statistic:**
- rₛ* = -0.593

**5. Rejection Region:**
- RR = {r ≤ -0.497} (one-tailed critical value for n=12 at α=0.05)

**6. Decision:**
- Since -0.593 < -0.497, we reject H₀

**Conclusion:**
There is statistically significant evidence (p < 0.05) of a negative rank correlation between rating and distance. This suggests that as distance increases, ratings tend to decrease.
