### Solution
Since it is a 95% confidence interval, so $alpha$ = 0.05
1. For T-value:   
$\quad$ Rejection region: $t>t_{0.025}$ or $t<-t_{0.025}$  
$\quad$ df = $27-1=26$, so the rejection region is $t>2.056$ or $t<-2.056$  
$\quad$ -2.056 < T-value = 1.64 < 2.056, so we do not reject $H_0$. We can't conclude that the average weight of ground beef in a supermarket meat display is different from 1.
  
2. For P-value:  
$\quad$ $P-value = 0.113 > \alpha = 0.05$, so we do not reject $H_0$.  
$\quad$ We can't conclude that the average weight of ground beef in a supermarket meat display is different from 1.
    
3. For 95% confidence interval:
$\quad$ The 95% confidence interval for $\mu$ is (0.9867,1.1178).  
$\quad$ $\bar{x} = 1.0522$ fall into the 95% confidence interval, so we do not reject $H_0$.  
$\quad$ Hence, we accept that the mean weight of packages of ground beef in a supermarket meat display is 1.
