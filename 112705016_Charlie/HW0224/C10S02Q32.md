### Solution
Since it is a 95% confidence interval, so $alpha$ = 0.05
1. For T-value:   
$\quad$ Rejection region: $t>t_{0.025}$ or $t<-t_{0.025}$  
$\quad$ df = $27-1=26$, so the rejection region is $t>2.056$ or $t<-2.056$  
$\quad$ -2.056 < T-value = 1.64 < 2.056, so we do not reject $H_0$. We can't conclude that the average weight of ground beef in a supermarket meat display is different from 1.
  
2. For P-value:  
$\quad$ $P-value = 0.113 > \alpha = 0.05$, so we do not reject $H_0$.  
$\quad$ We can't conclude that the average weight of ground beef in a supermarket meat display is different from 1.
    
3. For 95% confidence interval:

$$t_{\alpha/2} \Rightarrow t_{26;0.025}=2.056. \text{(From T-Table)}$$

$$\text{Construct 95 confidence interval}$$

$$
\bar{x} \pm t_{26; 0.025} \times \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} = 1.0522 \pm 2.056 \times \frac{0.1657}{\sqrt{27}} \approx (0.9867, 1.1178)
$$  
   
$\quad$ The 95% confidence interval for $\mu$ is (0.9867,1.1178).  
$\quad$ $\bar{x} = 1.0522$ fall into the 95% confidence interval, so we do not reject $H_0$.  
$\quad$ We can't conclude that the average weight of ground beef in a supermarket meat display is different from 1.

### Solution
The test statistic: 

$$
t_{\text{STAT}} = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{s / \sqrt{n}} \sim t_{n-1}
$$

The realized statistic 

$$
t^* = \frac{\bar{x} - 1}{s / \sqrt{n}} = \frac{1.0522 - 1}{0.1657 / \sqrt{27}} \approx 1.6369 \approx 1.64
$$

It is the same as the given value of MINITAB, so t is verified.

95% confidence interval:

$$t_{\alpha/2} \Rightarrow t_{26;0.025}=2.056. \text{(From T-Table)}$$

$$\text{Construct 95 confidence interval}$$

$$
\bar{x} \pm t_{26; 0.025} \times \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} = 1.0522 \pm 2.056 \times \frac{0.1657}{\sqrt{27}} \approx (0.9867, 1.1178)
$$  

The upper and lower confidence limits are the same as the MINITAB, so they are also verified.
