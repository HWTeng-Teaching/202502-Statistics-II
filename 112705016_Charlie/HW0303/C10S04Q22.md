### Solution

Let $x_1$ be the density of batter A ; $x_2$ be the density of batter B.

Define $D_i = x_{1i} - x_{2i}$ , which i represent the location.

$\bar{D} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} D_i$  , n = 6 in this case.

$\bar{D} = -0.01 $

$S_D \approx 0.0095289$  

1. $H_{0}: \mu_{1} - \mu_{2} = D_0 = 0  , H_{a}: \mu_{1} - \mu_{2} = D_0 \neq 0 $
2. Assume $\alpha = 0.05$
3. Test statistic and its sampling distribution:

$$
t_{STAT} = \frac{\bar{D} - D_0}{\frac{S_D}{\sqrt{n}}} \sim t\_{n-1} = t\_{5}
$$   

4. Realized test statistic :

$$
t^* = \frac{-0.01 - 0}{\frac{0.0095289}{\sqrt{6}}} \approx -2.5706
$$

5. Rejection Region :

$$t_{5 ; 0.025} = 2.571 \text{( two-tailed)}$$

$$\text{Reject }H_0 \text{ if t > 2.571 of t < -2.571}$$

6. Conclusion:

$$t^* = -2.5706 > -2.571 $$

$$\text{Non-reject }H_0$$

*The data can't present sufficient evidence that the densities of cakes may have a difference by using batter A & B*

### Solution

Constructing 95% Confidence Interval of $\mu_1 - \mu_2$

$$t\_{n-1 ; \alpha/2} = t\_{5 ; 0.025} = 2.571$$

$$
(\bar{D})\pm t\_{n-1 ; \alpha/2}\frac{S_D}{\sqrt{n}}
 = (-0.01)\pm 2.571(\frac{0.0095289}{\sqrt{6}}) \approx (-0.020001594, 0.000001594)$$

Since 0 is in the confidence interval, we non-reject $H_0$

*The data can't present sufficient evidence that the densities of cakes may have a difference by using batter A & B*
