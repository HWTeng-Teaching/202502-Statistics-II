## Question 
#### When using rule of thumb to check if two variance are the same , approximate the significance level with n1=4 and n2=3 

## Solution
the rule of thumb :

$$
\frac{S_1^2} {S_2^2} < 3 
$$

two variances are consider approximately equal.

Set signifinance level = $\alpha$.

$df_1 = 4-1 =3 \quad \quad df_2 = 3-1 = 2$

$$
P\[F>F_{3,2,\alpha}\] = \alpha ,\quad and \quad set \quad F_{3,2,\alpha} = 3
$$

$$
P\[F>3] \approx 0.26 = \alpha
$$

The approximate signifinance level = 0.26
