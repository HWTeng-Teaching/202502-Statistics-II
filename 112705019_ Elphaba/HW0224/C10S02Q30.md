### Solution
#### (a)  

$\quad \bar{x} = 20.3 \quad  \quad s = 5.0 \quad  \quad n = 21$  
  
1. $H_0: \mu = 25 \quad \quad H_a: \mu < 25$

2. Set the $\alpha = 0.05$

3. The test statistic and its distribution  

$$
t_{\text{STAT}} = \frac{\bar{x} - 25}{s / \sqrt{21}} \sim t_{20}
$$

4. The realized statistic

$$
t^* = \frac{\bar{x} - 25}{s / \sqrt{n}} = \frac{20.3 - 25}{5.0 / \sqrt{21}} \approx -4.3076
$$

5. Using a t-table with $df = n - 1 = 20$ at $\alpha = 0.05$ (one-tailed test). 
   Then the rejection region is $t < -1.725$

6. Because $t=-4.3076$ falls into the rejection region, we reject $H_0$, which means there is sufficient evidence to conclude that the true pretreatment mean is less than 25.
  
#### (b)  
$\quad \bar{x} = 26.6 \quad  \quad s = 7.4 \quad  \quad n = 21$  
$\quad$ The test statistic and its distribution  

$$
t_{\text{STAT}} = \frac{\bar{x} - 25}{s / \sqrt{n}} \sim t_{20}
$$

$$
P\left[-t_{\alpha/2} < \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{s / \sqrt{n}} < t_{\alpha/2} \right] = 1 - \alpha
$$

$$
P\left[\bar{X} - t_{\alpha/2} \cdot \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} < \mu < \bar{X} + t_{\alpha/2} \cdot \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} \right] = 1 - \alpha
$$

$\quad$ Therefore, the 95% confidence interval for the true posttreatment mean($\mu$) is 

$$
P\left[\bar{X} - t_{0.05/2} \cdot \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} < \mu < \bar{X} + t_{0.05/2} \cdot \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} \right] = 0.95
$$

$$
\mu \in \bar{X} \pm t_{0.05/2} \cdot \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} \quad  
$$

$$
\mu \in 26.6 \pm t_{0.025} \cdot \frac{7.4}{\sqrt{21}}
$$

$$
\mu \in 26.6 \pm 2.086 \cdot \frac{7.4}{\sqrt{21}}
$$

$$
\mu \in (23.2315,29.9685)
$$

#### (c) 
By analyzing the means:  
- Pretreatment: $20.3$  
- Posttreatment: $26.6$  
- Follow-up: $27.7$  

The means increase from pretreatment to posttreatment and further slightly increase at follow-up. Since the standard deviations are relatively moderate, this suggests that the treatment **likely has a positive effect** on self-esteem.  

Remark: Without being introduced to a formal test, we cannot determine if these differences are statistically significant.
