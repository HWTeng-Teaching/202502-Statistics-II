### Solution
#### (a)  
 
1. $H_0: \mu = 25, \quad H_a: \mu < 25$

2. Set $\alpha = 0.05$

3. Define the test statistic

$$
t_{\text{STAT}} = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{s / \sqrt{n}} \sim t_{n-1}
$$

4. Calculate the realized test statistic

$$
t^* = \frac{\bar{x} - 25}{s / \sqrt{n}} = \frac{20.3 - 25}{5.0 / \sqrt{21}} \approx -4.3076
$$

5. Rejection region

$$
t < -1.725
$$

6. t = -4.3076 <-1.725, so we reject $H_0: \mu = 25$, which means there is sufficient evidence concluding that the true pretreatment mean is less than 25.
  
#### (b)    

$\quad$ The 95% confidence interval for the true posttreatment mean($\mu$) 

$$
\mu \in \bar{X} \pm t_{0.05/2} \cdot \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} \quad \Rightarrow \mu \in 26.6 \pm 2.086 \cdot \frac{7.4}{\sqrt{21}}
$$

$$
\mu \in (23.2315,29.9685)
$$

#### (c) 
By analyzing the means:  
- Pretreatment: $20.3$  
- Posttreatment: $26.6$  
- Follow-up: $27.7$  

The means increase from pretreatment to posttreatment and further slightly increase at follow-up. Since the standard deviations are relatively moderate, this suggests that the treatment **likely has a positive effect** on self-esteem.  

Remark: Without being introduced to a formal test, we cannot determine if these differences are statistically significant.
