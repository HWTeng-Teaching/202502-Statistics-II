### Solution

If the points closely follow the straight line, we can say the data in the normal probability plots are from a normal distribution.  
Because the points in the normal probability plots are quite close to the straight line, we can say that the data appears to come from a normal distribution population.

### Solution

If the points closely follow the straight line, we can say the data in the normal probability plots are from a normal distribution.  
Because the points on the plot deviate from a straight line, it suggests that the sample quantiles do not align with the quantiles expected from a normal distribution. Consequently, it can be concluded that the observations do not follow a normal distribution.
