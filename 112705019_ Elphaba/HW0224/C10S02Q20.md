### Solution
$H_0:\mu = 74 \quad \quad, H_a: \mu \neq 74$, $\alpha=0.05$
  
3. The test statistic and its sampling distribution is  

$$
t_{\text{STAT}} = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{s / \sqrt{n}} \sim t_{(n - 1)}\quad \Rightarrow \quad t_{\text{STAT}} = \frac{\bar{x} - 74}{s / \sqrt{n}} \sim t_{24}
$$
     
4. Realized statistic 

$$
t^* = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{s / \sqrt{n}} = \frac{69.7 - 74}{16 / \sqrt{25}} = -1.34375
$$
     
5. Because the critical value is $t_{\alpha / 2} \Rightarrow t_{24;0.025}=2.064$. Therefore, the rejection region is $t < -2.064$ or $t > 2.064$.
     
7. Because $t = -1.34375$ does not fall into the rejection region, $H_0$ is not rejected, which means there is no sufficient evidence to show that the average CBF for stroke patients is different from that of healthy people.
