# Question
When using rule of thumb to check if two variancesare the same, approximate the significance level with n1 = 4 and n2 = 3.

## Solution
Rule of thumb: $if \frac{ \text{larger} S^2}{\text{smaller} S^2} <= 3$ , assume variances are same.

F test  
Rejection region {F: \$F_{3, 2, \alpha}$ > 3}  

$\alpha(\text{significance level}) = 0.26$
