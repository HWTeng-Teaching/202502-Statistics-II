## a  
F=5.704 > 4.26, so we can conclude that there is a significant difference in mean assembly times.  
P-value = 0.0251, which is smaller than α=0.05. We can also conclude that there is a significant difference in mean assembly times.

## b
99% CI for the difference in mean assembly times between persons trained by A and B
$\bar{X_A} - \bar{X_B} \pm t_{9,0.01/2} \sqrt{ MSE (\frac{1}{n_A} + \frac{1}{n_B})} = 60.5-54.667 \pm 3.25 \sqrt{14.941*(1/4+1/3)}$  
= (-3.761,15.427)

## c
99% CI for the mean assembly times for persons trained by A  
$\bar{X_A} \pm t_{9,0.01/2} \sqrt{\frac{MSE}{n_A}} = 60.5 \pm 3.25\sqrt{\frac{14.941}{4}}$
=(54.219, 66.781)

## d
The data generally meet the normality assumption for ANOVA. The variances are reasonably homogeneous, with the largest variance (21.7) being only 2.33 times greater than the smallest (9.33), below the common 431 threshold. The ranges (A: 57–64, B: 52–58, C: 58–71) show no extreme outliers or obvious skewness.

I think the data will satisfy the assumption that have been selected from normal population, since it randomly assigned employees ti each of three programs.
