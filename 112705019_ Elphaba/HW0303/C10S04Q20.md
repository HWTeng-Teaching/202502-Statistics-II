# Solution
d = [15,15,15,9,16,8,12,8,10,12,9,4,10,4,17,13,4,7,7,10]  
$\bar{d} = 10.25 \quad s_{d} \approx 4.0507$

1. $H_{0}: \mu_{1} − \mu_{2} = 0, H_{a} : \mu_{1} − \mu_{2} > 0.$
2. Set α = 0.05
3. Test statistic and its sampling distribution 
   
$\quad t_{STAT} = \frac{\bar{D} - 0}{S_{D} / \sqrt{n}} \sim t_{(n-1)}$

4. Realized test statistic: $t^{*} = \frac{10.25 - 0}{4.0507 / \sqrt{20}} \approx 11.3164$.
5. Rejection region {t: t>1.729}.
6. Because $t^{*}=11.3164 > 1.729$, we reject $H_{0}$. Thus, there is sufficient evidence concluding that the average recall score is higher when imagery is used.
