## (a)
d = [0.006,-0.018,-0.014,-0.011,-0.004,-0.019]  
$\bar{d} = -0.01 \quad s_{d} \approx 0.00953$

1. $H_{0}: \mu_{1} − \mu_{2} = 0, H_{a} : \mu_{1} − \mu_{2} \neq 0.$
2. Set α = 0.05
3. Test statistic and its sampling distribution 
   
$\quad t_{STAT} = \frac{\bar{D} - 0}{S_{D} / \sqrt{n}} \sim t_{(n-1)}$

4. Realized test statistic: $t^{*} = \frac{-0.01 - 0}{0.00953 / \sqrt{6}} \approx -2.57029$.
5. Rejection region {t:t<-2.571 or t>2.571}.
6. Because $t^{*}=-2.57029 > -2.571$, we do Not reject $H_{0}$. Thus, there is no sufficient evidence concluding that the average densities of cakes prepared by two types of batter are different.

## (b)
The 95% confidence interval for $(\mu_{1} − \mu_{2})$ is  
$\bar{d} \pm t_{(n-1); \alpha/2} \frac{S_{d}}{\sqrt{n}} $  
$(\mu_{1} − \mu_{2}) \in (-0.01 - 2.571 \frac{0.00953}{\sqrt{6}}, -0.01 + 2.571 \frac{0.00953}{\sqrt{6}}) \approx (-0.020, 0.0000027)$
