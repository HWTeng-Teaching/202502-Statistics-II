$H_0: p_1 = p_2 = p_3 = \frac{1}{3}, H_a:$ at least a $p_i$ is different from others.

$\alpha=0.05$

The test statistic:

$x^2 = \sum \frac{(O_i-E_i)^2}{E_i} \sim x^2_{k-1}$

Realized test statistic:

$E_i = np_i = \frac{83+61+56}{3} = 66.667$

${x^2}^* = \sum \frac{(O_i-E_i)^2}{E_i} = \frac{(83-66.667)^2}{66.667} + \frac{(61-66.667)^2}{66.667} + \frac{(56-66.667)^2}{66.667} = 6.190$

Reject region:

$x^2_{\alpha,(k-1)}={x^2}_{0.05,2}=5.99147$

Since ${x^2}^*= 6.190 > 5.99147$, we reject $H_0$ and say there is sufficient evidence to indicate that the data in the table indicate that there is a difference in preference for the three entrances.

The 95% C.I. :

$p = \hat{p} \pm Z_{\alpha/2} \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1 - \hat{p})}{n}} = 0.415 \pm 1.96 \sqrt{\frac{0.415(1 - 0.415)}{200}} = (0.347, 0.483)$
