## solution
$H_0: \text{The distributions of eye-movement rates for deaf children and hearing children are same.}$  
$H_a: \text{The distributions of eye-movement rates for deaf children and hearing children are different.}$  

$n1=9, \quad n2=9$  
$T_1(hearing children) = 45, \quad T_2(deaf children) = 126$    
$T^* = n1+(n1+n2+1) - T_1 = 9 x 19 - 45 = 126$

The statistic is:    
$min(T^*, T1) = min(126, 45) = 45$  

The critical value of T is for a two-tailed test with α/2 = .025 is T = 62  

$T_1 = 45 < 62, Reject H_0,$   
There's sufficient evidence to indicate the distributions of eye-movement rates for hearing children lies to the left of that for deaf children.
