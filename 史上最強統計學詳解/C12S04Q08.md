## Solution
### a.What assumptions must be made about the distribution of the random error ε?
The random error ε must have a normal distribution with mean 0 and a common variance $\sigma^2$ , independent of x.  

### b.What is the best estimate of $\sigma^2$, the variance of the random error ε?
The best estimate of $\sigma^2$ is the **Mean Square Error (MSE)**: $\sigma^2 \approx \text{MSE} = 58.05$

### c.Use the diagnostic plots for these data to comment on the validity of the regression assumptions.
The normal probability plot shows a slight departure from normality in the tails.  
The residual plot may include one unusual point, but no major violations of regression assumptions are evident.  
Thus, the model appears reasonably appropriate for the data.
