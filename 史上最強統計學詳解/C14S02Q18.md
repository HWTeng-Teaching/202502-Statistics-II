## Solution

$H_0: p_1 = 1/3,p_2 = 1/3,p_3 = 1/3, H_a:$ at least a $p_i$ is different from $1/3$

set $\alpha=0.05$

The test statistic and its sampling distribution:

$$
x^2 = \sum \frac{(O_i-E_i)^2}{E_i} \sim x^2_{k-1}
$$

The realized statistic:

$E_i = np_i = (83+61+56)*(1/3) = 66.667$

$$
{x^2}^* = \sum \frac{(O_i-E_i)^2}{E_i} = \frac{(83-66.667)^2}{66.667} + \frac{(61-66.667)^2}{66.667} + \frac{(56-66.667)^2}{66.667} = 6.190
$$

Set the reject region:

$x^2_{\alpha,(k-1)}={x^2}_{0.05,2}=5.99147$

if ${x^2}^*>5.99147$, we would reject $H_0$

Since ${x^2}^*= 6.190 > 5.99147$, we would reject $H_0$.

There is sufficient evidence to indicate that the data in the table indicate that there is a difference in preference for the three entrances.

The 95% C.I. is:

$$
p = \hat{p} \pm Z_{\alpha/2} \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1 - \hat{p})}{n}}
$$

$\hat{p} = 83/200 = 0.415$
$Z_{\alpha/2} = Z_{0.025} = 1.96$

$$
p = 0.415 \pm 1.96 \sqrt{\frac{0.415(1 - 0.415)}{200}}
$$

$$
p = (0.347, 0.483)
$$
