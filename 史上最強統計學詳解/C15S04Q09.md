## Solution 
# a
|Pair| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
|----|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|popilation 1- population 2 |0.1|0.7|0.3|-0.1|0.5|0.2|0.5|
|rank|1.5| 7 | 4 |1.5| 5.5 | 3 | 5.5 | 

$T^+ = 1.5 + 7 + 4 + 5.5 + 3 + 5.5 = 26.5$  
$T^-=1.5$  
1. $H_0$ : the distribution of two populations are the same , $H_a$ : the distribution of two populations are different 
2. set $\alpha = 0.1$      
3. test statistic: $T = min(T^+, T^-) , n=7$    
4. realized statistic: $T = min(T^+, T^-) = min(26.5,1.5) = 1.5$    
5. Rejection Region: { $T | T \leq 4$}
6. $T=1.5\leq 4$ and it is in the rejection region. It rejects $H_0.$ There is a significant difference between the two populations.

# b
using the sign test(in Section 15.2 Exercise 4) : non-reject $H_0$  
using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test : reject $H_0$   
They are not the same.  
The reason is that the sign test only considers the sign of the differences but without the consideration of the rank of differences. However, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test involve this informaiton. Therefore it is more powerful than the sign test and it's an improved approach.
