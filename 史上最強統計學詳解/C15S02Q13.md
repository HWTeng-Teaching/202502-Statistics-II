- After counting and summing, the results show that:
  - Positive signs (+): 8 cases (Drug B better)
  - Negative signs (-): 2 cases (Drug A better)
  - Ties: 0 cases

- We now set up the hypotheses:
  - $H_0~$: $p(+) = p(-) = 0.5$ $\~$ $i.e.$ $\~$ there are no difference between drugs
  - $H_a~$: $p(+) \geq p(-)$ $\~$ $i.e.$ $\~$ drug B has higher recovery rate

- For $n =10$ (excluding no ties) and $p=0.5$:
  - After seeking the binomial table, we get that:
 
$$
P(X \geq 8) = 1-P(X \leq 7) = 1 - 0.945 = 0.055 \approx 0.05 = \alpha
$$

- Remarks:
  - Using `=CRITBINOM(10, 0.5, 0.95)` in excel will also get the same result of 8
  - In mathematics, the binomial distribution is **discrete**, meaning that $X$ can only take integer values from 0 to $n$, so probabilities like $P(X \geq k)$ are **only meaningful when $k$ is an integer**.
 
⇒The rejection region is:

$$
R.R. = \lbrace X \mid X \in [8,10) \rbrace
$$

### Part (b)
The Student's t-test would be inappropriate for this analysis because:

- **Non-Normal Data**: The recovery rates are percentages (bounded between 0-100%) and may not follow a normal distribution, violating a key assumption of the t-test.
  - t-test assumes continuous, normally distributed data, but this study uses recovery rates (percentages), which are proportional data with critical limitations:
    - Bounded range (0%-100%), violating the normal distribution's infinite range assumption
    - Severe skewness when proportions approach 0% or 100%
      
- **Paired Binary Outcomes**: The data represents counts of recoveries (binary outcomes) within different sample sizes at each hospital, making the t-test's assumptions about continuous data problematic.
  - **Heteroscedasticity**: t-test assumes equal variance, but smaller hospitals show greater volatility
  - **Unequal weighting**: t-test treats all hospitals equally despite reliability differences
