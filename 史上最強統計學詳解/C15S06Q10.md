## Solution

### (a)
The randomized block design is used in collecting these data.  
Five children are blocks, and four antibiotics are treatments.  
Collecting data in that way is able to control for variability among children and observe the effect of the antibiotics.

### (b)

The usual analysis of variance assumptions are that:
1. Data in each treatment should follow normal distribution. $\Rightarrow$  Residuals should follow normal distribution.  
2. There is a common variance for each treatment group.  $\Rightarrow$  There is a same variance for residuals.  
  
For the normal probability plot, the points lie very close to the line and there are no outliers. Therefore, the residuals are approximately normally distributed.   

For the scatter plot of residuals and antibiotic, we can observe that the variance of antibiotic 1 is different from the variance of antibiotic 2. Therefore, there may be no common variance in the data.  
  
The normal distribution assumption is satisfied, but the common variance assumption is not satisfied.  


### (c)
nonparametric randomized block design test: Friedman $F_r$ -test  
|rank| T1| T2| T3| T4|
|:--:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| B1 | 2 | 1 | 4 | 3 |
| B2 | 2 | 3 | 1 | 4 |
| B3 | 3 | 1 | 2 | 4 |
| B4 | 2 | 4 | 1 | 3 |
| B5 | 3 | 4 | 2 | 1 |

$T_1 = 12 \quad \quad T_2 = 13 \quad \quad T_3 = 10 \quad \quad T_4 = 15$  

$b = 5 \quad \quad k=4$  
  
1. $H_0$ : The 4 distributions are identical $\quad \quad H_a$ : at least one distribution is different

2. $\alpha = 0.05$

3. test statistic

$$
F_{r,STAT} = \frac{12}{bk(k+1)} \sum T_i^2 - 3b(k+1) \sim \chi^2_{(k-1)=3}
$$

4. realized statistic

$$
F_r^* = \frac{12}{8*4\*5} \sum (12^2+13^2+10^2+15^2) - 3\*8\*5 =1.56
$$

5. rejection region, RR = $\\{F_r: F_r > \chi^2_{0.05;3}\\} = \\{F_r: F_r > 7.81473\\}$

6. Because $F_r=1.56$ does not fall into the rejection region, $H_0$ is not rejected, which means that there is no significant difference in the distributions of reponses to the tastes of the four antibiotics.
