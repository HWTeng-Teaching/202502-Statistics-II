## Solution
### a.
$H_0: \mu_A = \mu_B = \mu_c, H_a:$ at least one mean is different

set $\alpha = 0.01$

Test statistic and its sampling distribution:

$$
F_{\text{STAT}} = \frac{MST}{MSE} \sim F_{(k-1),(n-k)}
$$

From the ANOVA table: $p-value$ of $F^* = 0.0251$

Find the reject region:

if $p-value < \alpha$, reject $H_0$

Since $p-value = 0.0251 > 0.01$, we would not reject $H_0$

The data don't indicate a significant difference in mean assembly times for people trained by the three programs.

### b.
set $\alpha = 0.01$

$t_{n-k,\alpha/2} = t_{9,0.005} = 3.250$

The 99% C.I. is:

$$
\mu_A - \mu_B \in (\bar{x}_A-\bar{x}_B) \pm t\_{n-k,\alpha/2} * \sqrt{MSE*(\frac{1}{n_A} + \frac{1}{n_B})}
$$

$$
\mu_A - \mu_B \in (60.5 - 54.667) \pm 3.250 * \sqrt{14.941*(\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{3})}
$$

$$
\mu_A - \mu_B \in (-3.762, 15.428)
$$

Because 0 is in the C.I., we could say that there is no sufficient evidence that there is significant difference between in mean assembly times.

### c.
set $\alpha = 0.01$

$t_{n-k,\alpha/2} = t_{9,0.005} = 3.250$

The 99% C.I. is:

$$
\mu_A \in \bar{x}_A \pm t\_{n-k,\alpha/2} * \sqrt{\frac{MSE}{n_A}}
$$

$$
\mu_A \in 60.5 \pm 3.250 * \sqrt{\frac{14.941}{4}}
$$

$$
\mu_A \in (54.219, 66.781)
$$

### d.
The value of three programs are symmetric.
The median is close to mean.
The data close to median.
We could say that the data will satisfy the assumption that they have been selected from normal populations, because the data doesn’t show obvious skewness or extreme outliers in any group
