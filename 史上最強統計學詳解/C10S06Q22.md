## Solution
## (a)

**1: Hypotheses**  
- **Null Hypothesis $H_0$**: Variances are equal $σ_1^2 = σ_2^2$.  
- **Alternative Hypothesis $H_1$**: Variances are not equal $σ_1^2 \neq σ_2^2$ (two-tailed test).  

**2: Calculate the F-statistic**  
- Larger variance: $s_2^2 = 2.96$  
- Smaller variance: $s_1^2 = 1.54$ 
- F-statistic:  
  $$F = \frac{s_2^2}{s_1^2} = \frac{2.96}{1.54} \approx 1.92$$

**3: Degrees of Freedom**  
- Numerator $df_1 = n_2 - 1 = 14$ (for $s_2^2$)  
- Denominator $df_2 = n_1 - 1 = 14$ (for $s_1^2$)  

**4: Determine the p-value**  
- Use the F-distribution with $df_1 = 14$, $df_2 = 14$.  
- For $F = 1.92$, the **one-tailed p-value** (right-tail) is approximately **0.12**.  
- Since this is a two-tailed test:  
  $$p\text{-value} = 2 \times 0.12 = 0.24$$

**5: Conclusion**  
- The **p-value = 0.24** is **greater than $\alpha = 0.05$**.  
- **Fail to reject $H_0$**: No significant evidence of a difference in variances.

## (b)

$$\frac{s_1^2}{s_2^2} = \frac{1.54}{2.96} \approx 0.5203$$

- For a 99% confidence interval $α = 0.0$, use $α/2 = 0.005$.  
- Critical values for $F_{0.005, 14, 14}$ and $F_{0.995, 14, 14} = \frac{1}{F_{0.005, 14, 14}}$.  
- From F-tables or software:  
  
  $$F_{0.005, 14, 14} \approx 4.31 \quad \text{and} \quad F_{0.995, 14, 14} \approx \frac{1}{3.81} \approx 0.232$$

**Compute the Interval**  

$$\text{CI} = \left( \frac{s_1^2}{s_2^2} \times F_{0.995, 14, 14}, \frac{s_1^2}{s_2^2} \times F_{0.005, 14, 14} \right)$$

$$\text{CI} = \left( 0.5203 \times 0.232, 0.5203 \times 4.31 \right) \approx \left( 0.120, 2.242 \right)$$

**Interpretation**  
- The 99% confidence interval for $\frac{σ_1^2}{σ_2^2}$ is **(0.120, 2.242)**.  
- Since the interval includes 1, there is no significant difference in variances at the 99% confidence level.
