# **Interpretation of MINITAB One-Sample T-Test Results**

## **1. Descriptive Statistics**

| Sample Size (N) | Mean | Standard Deviation (StDev) | Standard Error (SE Mean) | 95% Confidence Interval (CI) |
|----------------|------|--------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| 27             | 1.0522 | 0.1657                   | 0.0319                  | (0.9867, 1.1178)          |

- The sample consists of **27 packages of ground beef**.
- The **mean weight** is **1.0522 lbs**.
- The **standard deviation** is **0.1657 lbs**, and the **standard error** is **0.0319 lbs**.
- The **95% confidence interval** for the population mean (μ) is **(0.9867, 1.1178)**, meaning we are 95% confident that the true mean weight is within this range.

## **2. Hypothesis Test**

- **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** μ = 1 (The mean weight is 1 lb)
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** μ ≠ 1 (The mean weight is different from 1 lb)

| T-Value | P-Value |
|---------|---------|
| 1.64    | 0.113   |

- The **t-value is 1.64**, which measures how far the sample mean is from the hypothesized mean in terms of standard error.
- The **p-value is 0.113**, indicating the probability of observing such a result (or a more extreme one) if the null hypothesis is true.

## **3. Conclusion**

- The standard **significance level (α) is 0.05**:
  - If **p ≤ 0.05**, we reject H₀ and conclude there is a significant difference.
  - If **p > 0.05**, we fail to reject H₀.

- Since **p = 0.113 > 0.05**, we **fail to reject the null hypothesis**, meaning there is **not enough statistical evidence to conclude that the mean weight is significantly different from 1 lb**.

## **4. Interpretation**
Although the sample mean **(1.0522 lbs)** is slightly higher than 1 lb, the statistical test suggests that this difference **may be due to random variation** rather than a true difference in the population mean. Therefore, we **cannot conclude that the actual mean weight differs significantly from 1 lb**.

---
**Summary:**
- **Sample mean = 1.0522 lbs, 95% CI = (0.9867, 1.1178)**
- **t = 1.64, p = 0.113**
- **Conclusion: We do not have enough evidence to say that the mean weight is different from 1 lb.**

# **Verification of t-Value and Confidence Limits**

## **Given Data:**
- **Sample size (n)** = 27
- **Sample mean (\(\bar{x}\))** = 1.0522
- **Sample standard deviation (s)** = 0.1657
- **Standard error (SE Mean)** = 0.0319
- **Null hypothesis mean (\(\mu_0\))** = 1
- **Confidence level** = 95%

## **Step 1: Calculate the t-Value**
The t-value for a one-sample t-test is given by:

\[
t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{SE}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
t = \frac{1.0522 - 1}{0.0319} = \frac{0.0522}{0.0319} \approx 1.64
\]

This matches the given **t-value = 1.64**.

---

## **Step 2: Calculate the Confidence Interval (CI)**
The formula for the confidence interval is:

\[
\bar{x} \pm t^* \times SE
\]

where **\( t^* \)** is the critical t-value at **\( \alpha/2 = 0.025 \)** (for 95% confidence level) with **\( df = n - 1 = 26 \)**.

Using a **t-table** or calculator, the critical **\( t^* \) value for 26 degrees of freedom at 95% confidence** is **\( t^* = 2.056 \)**.

\[
\text{Lower Limit} = 1.0522 - (2.056 \times 0.0319) = 1.0522 - 0.0656 = 0.9866
\]

\[
\text{Upper Limit} = 1.0522 + (2.056 \times 0.0319) = 1.0522 + 0.0656 = 1.1178
\]

Thus, the **95% confidence interval is (0.9867, 1.1178)**, which matches the given interval.

---

## **Final Verification:**
- **t-value = 1.64** ✅ Matches
- **95% Confidence Interval = (0.9867, 1.1178)** ✅ Matches
