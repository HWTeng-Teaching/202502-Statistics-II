# Answer  
## a.

$H_0$: The distribution of the yields for these five different varieties of wheat are identical.  
$H_a$: At least one of the distribution of the yields will be different.  
  
So our treatment is variety and block is location.  
$T_1\ =\ 4+2+3+3+3+3 = 18$  
$T_2\ =\ 1+3+2+2+2+2 = 12$  
$T_3\ =\ 5+4+4+4+4+5 = 26$  
$T_4\ =\ 3+5+5+5+5+4 = 27$  
$T_5\ =\ 2+1+1+1+1+1 = 7$  

$F_r\ =\ \frac{12}{bk(k+1)} \sum{T_i}^{2} -3b(k+1)$  
$F_r\ =\ \frac{12}{6x5x6} (18^2+12^2+26^2+27^2+7^2)-3x6x6 = 20.133$  
  
Look at the chart and we'll see that  
$X^2_{4, 0.05}\ =\ 9.49$  
Because $F_r\ = \ 20.133 > 9.49$, we reject $H_0$  
That means at least one of the distribution of the yields will be different.  

## b.  

In order to get the p-value of the $F_r$ that we got from the previous problem, we look it up in the p-value to $F_r$ chart.  
We will know that the p-value of $X^2_{4, 0.01}$ is 13.28 and 13.28<20.133, which means the p-value we're looking for is < 0.01.  
Compare to the F and p-value the problem gave us, we know that both of these data state that we are rejecting $H_0$, so at least one of the distribution of the yields will not be the same.
