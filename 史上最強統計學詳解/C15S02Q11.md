$H_0: p=0.5$  
$H_a: p \neq 0.5$  

#### a.

n = 20 (omit the tied pair)  

$\alpha = 0.05$  

test statistic:  
x = number of plus sign  

realized statistic:  
$x^* = 11$  

$p-value = 2 \times P(X >= 11) = 2 \times (1-0.588) = 0.824$  

$\because 0.824 > 0.05$  

$\therefore \text{non-reject } H_0$  

there is no sufficient evidence to indicate that one of the chefs tends to give higer ratings than the other  

---

#### b.

$\alpha = 0.05$  

$z_{STAT} = \frac{x-0.5n}{0.5\sqrt{n}}$  

$z^* = \frac{11 - 0.5 \times 20}{0.5 \times \sqrt{20}} = 0.4472$  

rejection region:  
$\left| z \right|>= 1.96$  

$\because 0.4472 < 1.96$  

$\therefore \text{non-reject } H_0$  

there is no sufficient evidence to indicate that one of the chefs tends to give higer ratings than the other  

---

### c.

the results of part a. and part b. are the same
