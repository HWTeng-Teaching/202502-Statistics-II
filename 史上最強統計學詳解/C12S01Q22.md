By observing the graph, we can see that the slope of the line is positive, which means the longer the arm span, the taller the height. The two variables are positive correlated.

### b.
If da Vinci is correct, the slope of the regression line would be approximately 1. This indicates that for every unit increase in armspan, the height also increases by about the same amount.

### c.
$\hat{y} = a + b x$

$n = 8, \bar{x} = 166, \bar{y} = 166.375, \sum x_i y_i = 221414, \sum x_i = 1328, \sum y_i = 1331, \sum x_i^2 = 221016$

$b = \frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}} = \frac{\sum x_i y_i - \frac{(\sum x_i)(\sum y_i)}{n}}{\sum x_i^2 - \frac{(\sum x_i)^2}{n}} = \frac{221414 - \frac{1328 * 1331}{8}}{221016 - \frac{1328 ^ 2}{8}} = \frac{468}{568} = 0.8239$

$a = \bar{y} - b \bar{x} = 166.375 - 0.8239 * 166 = 29.6076$

The regression line : $\hat{y} = 29.6076 + 0.8239 x$

The slope of the regression line is 0.8239, which is approximately 1. Therefore, the value of the slope $b$ confirm my conclusions.

### d. 

The regression line : $\hat{y} = 29.6076 + 0.8239 x$

If $x = 157, \hat{y} = 29.6076 + 0.8239 * 157 = 158.9599$

Thus, we would predict the person's height to be 158.9599 centimeters.
