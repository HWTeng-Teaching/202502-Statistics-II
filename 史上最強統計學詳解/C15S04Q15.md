## Solution

### (a)

Three common procedures for comparing paired data:

1. **Paired t-test (parametric)**
2. **Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test (nonparametric)**
3. **Sign Test (nonparametric)**

####  Assumptions for the **paired t-test**:

* The data are paired (same student under both conditions) 
* The paired differences are independent 
* The differences follow a **normal distribution**

The third assumption is **not satisfied** because the differences appear skewed or unevenly distributed. Therefore, **nonparametric tests** like the **Wilcoxon** or **Sign test** are more appropriate here.

####  Sign Test

* **Null hypothesis $H_0$**: No difference in median recall scores (p = 0.5)
* **Alternative $H_a$**: Scores are different (p ≠ 0.5)
* **Number of positive differences**: 20
* **Number of negative differences**: 0
* **Test statistic**: $x = 20$
* **p-value**: $2 \times P(X \geq 20) = 0$
* **Conclusion**: Since $p < 0.05$, we **reject** $H_0$. There's a significant difference in recall performance.

####  Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test

* **Total positive rank sum**: $T^+ = 210$
* **Total negative rank sum**: $T^- = 0$
* **Test statistic**: $T = \min(T^+, T^-) = 0$
* **Rejection region** (n = 20, two-tailed, α = 0.05): $T \leq 52$
* **Conclusion**: $T = 0 < 52$, so we **reject** $H_0$. There's a significant difference.

###  (c)
Yes, **both the Sign Test and the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test lead to the same conclusion**:

There is a statistically significant difference between the recall scores **with imagery** and **without imagery**.
