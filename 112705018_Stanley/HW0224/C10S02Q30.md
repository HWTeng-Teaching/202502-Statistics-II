## Solution to Question 30
### a.
$H_0 : \mu = 25$  

$H_a : \mu < 25$

set $\alpha = 0.05$

Pretreatment : $\bar{x} = 20.3, s = 5.0, n = 21$           

$t_{\text{STAT}} = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{s / \sqrt{n}} \sim t_{n-1}$  

$t^* = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{s / \sqrt{n}} = \frac{20.3 - 25}{5.0 / sqrt{21}} \approx -4.308$

Because $df = n - 1 = 20$ and $\alpha = 0.05$, the critical point is $-t_{0.05} = -1.725$

Therefore, the rejection region is $t < -1.725$

Since $t^* = -4.308 < -1.725, H_0$ will be rejected.

There is sufficient evidence to conclude that the true pretreatment mean is less than 25.

### b.
Posttreatment : $\bar{x} = 26.6, s = 7.4, n = 21$

Constructing a 95% confidence interval for the true posttreatment mean:

$\quad \mu \in \bar{x} \pm t_{\alpha / 2, n-1} \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}, \alpha = 0.05$

$\quad t_{0.025, 20} = 2.086$

$\quad \mu \in 26.6 \pm 2.086 \frac{7.4}{\sqrt{21}} \approx (23.232, 29.968)$

### c.
From the table we can observe that there is an increase in the sample means from pretreatment to posttreatment
and posttreatment to follow-up. It suggest that the treatment had a significant effect, and the effect can last over time.
