## Solution to Question 20
$\mu = 74, n = 25, \bar{x} = 69.7, s = 16$ 

$H_0 : \mu = 74 \quad H_a : \mu \neq 74$

$\alpha$ is given by the question, which is equal to $0.05$

The test statistic and its sampling distribution is

$\quad t_{\text{STAT}} = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{s / \sqrt{n}} \sim t_{n-1}$

The realized statistic is

$\quad t^* = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{s / \sqrt{n}} = \frac{69.7 - 74}{16 / \sqrt{25}} = -1.344$

Because $\alpha = 0.05$, the critical points are $\pm t_{\alpha / 2} = \pm t_{0.05 / 2} = \pm t_{0.025}$

Then, Since $df = n - 1 = 24$, $\pm t_{0.025} = \pm 2.064$

Therefore, the rejection region is $t < -2.064$ or $t > 2.064$

Because $t^* = -1.344 > -2.064, H_0$ will not be rejected.

There is no sufficient evidence to prove that the average CBF for stroke patients is different that of healthy people.
