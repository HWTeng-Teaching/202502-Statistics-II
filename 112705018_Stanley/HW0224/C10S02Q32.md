## Solution to Question 32
### a.
$H_0 : \mu = 1$  
$H_1 : \mu \neq 1$  
set $\alpha = 0.05$ 
#### T-Value Analysis
$\t_{STAT} \sim t_{n-1}} 

$T-value = 1.64$

$df = n - 1 = 27 - 1 = 26, t_{0.025, 26} = 2.056$

Reject $H_0$ if $t > 2.056$ or $t < -2.056$

Because $t = 1.64 < 2.056$, we would not reject $H_0$

There is no significant evidence to conclude that the mean weight of packages of ground beef is different from 1.

#### P-Value Analysis
If $P-value < \alpha$, reject $H_0$

Because $P-value = 0.113 > 0.05$, we would not reject $H_0$

There is no significant evidence to conclude that the mean weight of packages of ground beef is different from 1.

#### Estimation Procedures
If bar{x} is not in the 95% Confidence Interval, reject $H_0$

the 95% CI for $\mu = (0.9867, 1.1178)$

Because $\bar{x}$ = 1.0522 is in the CI, we would not reject $H_0$

There is no significant evidence to conclude that the mean weight of packages of ground beef is different from 1.

### b.
$n = 27, \bar{x} = 1.0522, s = 0.1657, \mu = 1$
#### T-Value
$t^* = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{s / \sqrt{n}} = \frac{1.0522 - 1}{0.1657 / sqrt{27}} \approx 1.637 \approx 1.64$

T-value is consistent with MINITAB printout.

#### Confidence Interval
$\mu \in \bar{x} \pm t_{\alpha / 2, n-1} \frac{s}{sqrt{n}}$

$\alpha = 0.05, t_{0.05 / 2, 27-1} = t_{0.025, 26} = 2.056$

$\mu \in 1.0522 \pm 2.056 \frac{0.1657}{\sqrt{27}} = (0.9867, 1.1178)$

The upper confidence limit = 1.1178 and the lower confidence limit = 0.9867 are consistent with MINITAB printout.
