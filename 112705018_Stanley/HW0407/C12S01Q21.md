## Solution to Question 21

### a.
$\hat{y} = a + b x$

$n = 10, \bar{x} = 26.49, \bar{y} = 27.2, \sum x_i y_i = 14922.41, \sum x_i^2 = 221016$

$b = \frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}} = \frac{\sum x_i y_i - n\bar{x}\bar{y}}{\sum x_i^2 - n\bar{x}^2} = \frac{14922.41 - 8 * 26.49 * 27.2}{221016 - 10 * 26.49^2} = 0.9746$

$a = \bar{y} - b \bar{x} = 27.2 - 0.9746 * 26.49 = 1.3828$

The regression line : $\hat{y} = 1.3828 + 0.9746 x$

### b.

Since the data points are all close to the least-squares regression line, we can conclude that the assumption of a linear relationship appears to be reasonable.
