## Solution to Question 14

for New System:

$n_1 = 30, \bar{x_1} = 246, s_1 = 15.6$

for Old System:

$n_2 = 30, \bar{x_2} = 240, s_2 = 28.2$

1. $H_0 : \frac{\sigma_{2}^2}{\sigma_{1}^2} = 1; H_a : \frac{\sigma_{2}^2}{\sigma_{1}^2} > 1$

2. Set $\alpha = 0.05$

3. Test statistic and its sampling distribution:

   $F_{STAT} = \frac{s_{2}^2}{s_{1}^2} \sim F_{n_{2}-1, n_{1}-1}$

4. Realized test statistic: $F^* = \frac{s_{2}^2}{s_{1}^2} = \frac{28.2^2}{15.6^2} \approx 3.268$

5. Rejection Region : $\\{p-value \mid p-value < 0.05 \\}$

   Finding p-value: $p-value = P(F_{29, 29} > 3.268) \approx 0.00105$ (calculated in Python)

6. Because $p-value = 0.00105 < 0.05$, which falls in the rejection region, we reject $H_0$. Therefore, the data present sufficient evidence to conclude that the variability in daily production warrants increased maintenance of the older fabricating  system.
