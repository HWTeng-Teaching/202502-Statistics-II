## Solution to Question 22

### a.

$n_1 = n_2 = 15$

1. $H_0 : \frac{\sigma_{2}^2}{\sigma_{1}^2} = 1; H_a : \frac{\sigma_{2}^2}{\sigma_{1}^2} \neq 1$

2. Set $\alpha = 0.05$

3. Test statistic and its sampling distribution:

   $F_{STAT} = \frac{s_{2}^2}{s_{1}^2} \sim F_{n_{2}-1, n_{1}-1}$

4. Realized test statistic: $F^* = \frac{s_{2}^2}{s_{1}^2} = \frac{2.96}{1.54} \approx 1.922$

5. Rejection Region : $\\{p-value \mid p-value < 0.05 \\}$

   Finding p-value : $p-value = 2 * P(F_{14, 14} > 1.922) \approx 0.23386$ (calculated in Python)

6. Because $p-value = 0.23386 > 0.05$, which doesn't fall in the rejection region, we don't reject $H_0$. Therefore, these data doesn't present sufficient evidence to indicate a difference between the variabilities of the closing prices of the two stocks for the populations associated with the two samples.

### b.

Constructing a 99 % C.I. for $\frac{s_{2}^2}{s_{1}^2}$ :

$(\frac{s_{2}^2}{s_{1}^2} \frac{1}{F_{v_2, v_1; \alpha/2}}, \frac{s_{2}^2}{s_{1}^2} F_{v_1, v_2; \alpha/2}) = (\frac{2.96}{1.54} \frac{1}{F_{14, 14; 0.005}}, \frac{2.96}{1.54} F_{14, 14, 0.005}) = (\frac{2.96}{1.54 * 4.99929}, \frac{2.96}{1.54} * 4.99929) = (0.4471, 8.2636)$
