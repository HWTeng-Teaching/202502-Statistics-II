## Solution to Question 16

$s_1 = 114, s_2 = 103$

1. $H_0 : \frac{\sigma_{1}^2}{\sigma_{2}^2} = 1; H_a : \frac{\sigma_{1}^2}{\sigma_{2}^2} \neq 1$

2. Set $\alpha = 0.05$

3. Test statistic and its sampling distribution:

   $F_{STAT} = \frac{s_{1}^2}{s_{2}^2} \sim F_{n_{1}-1, n_{2}-1}$

4. Realized test statistic: $F^* = \frac{s_{1}^2}{s_{2}^2} = \frac{114^2}{103^2} \approx 1.225$

5. Rejection Region : $\\{p-value \mid p-value < 0.05 \\}$

   Finding p-value: $p-value = 2 * P(F_{14, 14} > 1.225) \approx 0.70942$ (calculated in Python)

6. Because $p-value = 0.70942 > 0.05$, which doesn't fall in the rejection region, we don't reject $H_0$. Therefore, there isn't sufficient evidence to conclude that the two population variances are different.
