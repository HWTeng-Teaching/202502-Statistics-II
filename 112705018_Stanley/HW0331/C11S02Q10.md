## Solution to Quesiton 10
### a.
$F = 5.704 > 4.256$, therefore, the data indicate a significant difference in mean assembly times for people trained by the three programs.

$p-value = 0.0251 < 0.05$, therefore, the data indicate a significant difference in mean assembly times for people trained by the three programs.

### b.
The 99% C.I. for $\mu_A - \mu_B$ : 

$\bar{x_A} - \bar{x_B} \pm t_{n-2; \alpha/2} * \sqrt{MSE * (\frac{1}{n_A} + \frac{1}{n_B})} = 60.5 - 54.667 \pm 3.25 * \sqrt{14.941 * (\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{3})} = (-3.762, 15.428)$

### c.
The 99% C.I. for $\mu_A$ : 

$\bar{x_A} \pm t_{n-2, \alpha/2} * * \sqrt{MSE * \frac{1}{n_A}} = 60.5 \pm 3.25 * \sqrt{14.941 * \frac{1}{4}} = (54.219, 66.781)$

### d. 
The data would satisfy the assumption that they have been selected from normal populations because there is no extreme outlier and the shape of the data isn't obviously skewed.
