## Solution to Question 12

Above Town : Observation 1
Below Town : Observation 2

### a.

| Observation |  2  |  1  |  2  |  1  |  2  |  2  |  1  |  2  |  1  |  1  |
|-------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|    data     | 4.7 | 4.8 | 4.8 | 4.9 | 4.9 | 4.9 | 5.0 | 5.0 | 5.1 | 5.2 |
|    rank     |  1  | 2.5 | 2.5 |  5  |  5  |  5  | 7.5 | 7.5 |  9  | 10  |

1. $H_0$ : The two population distributions are the same. $H_a$ : Population 1 is to the right of population 2.

2. $n_1 = n_2 = 5, T_1 = 2.5 + 5 + 7.5 + 9 + 10 = 34, T_1^* = n_1 (n_1 + n_2 + 1) - T_1 = 5 * 11 - 34 = 21$

3. the statistic is $T = T_1^* = 21$

4. The critical value from table for a one-tailed test with $\alpha = 0.05$ is $T = 19$; $H_0$ is rejected if $T <= 19$

5. Since the statistic $T = 21$, we don't reject $H_0$. There isn't sufficient evidence to confirm the theory.


### b.

Above Town : $\bar{X}_1 = \frac{4.8 + 5.2 + 5.0 + 4.9 + 5.1}{5} = 5, s_1^2 = 0.025$

Below Town : $\bar{X}_2 = \frac{5.0 + 4.7 + 4.9 + 4.8 + 4.9}{5} = 4.86, s_2^2 = 0.013$

According to Rule of Thumb, $\frac{larger \ s^2}{smaller \ s^2} = \frac{0.025}{0.013} \approx 1.923 < 3$

We can assume that the underlying variences are equal.

Pool estimator $S^2 = \frac{(n_1 - 1)s_1^2 + (n_2 - 1)s_2^2}{n_1 + n_2 - 2} = \frac{(5 - 1)0.025 + (5 - 1)0.013}{5 + 5 - 2} = 0.019$

1. $H_0 : \mu_1 - \mu_2 = 0, H_a : \mu_1 - \mu_2 > 0$

2. set $\alpha = 0.05$

3. Test statistic and its sampling distribution:

   $t_{STAT} = \frac{(\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2) - 0}{\sqrt{S^2(\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2})}} \sim  t\_{n_1 + n_2 - 2}$

4. Realized test statistic:

   $t^* = \frac{(5 - 4.86) - 0}{\sqrt{0.019(\frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{5})}} = 1.606$

5. Rejection Region:

   $t\_{n_1 + n_2 - 2, \alpha} = t_{5 + 5 - 2, 0.05} = t_{8, 0.05} = 1.860$

   Therefore, the rejection region :
   $\\{t \mid t  > 1.860 \\}$

6. Because $t^*  = 1.606 < 1.860$, which doesn't fall in the rejection region, we do not reject $H_0$

   The data can't provide sufficient evidence to indicate that the mean oxygen content below the town is less than the mean oxygen content above.

   The result is consistent with part a.
