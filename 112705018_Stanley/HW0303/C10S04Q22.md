## Solution to Question 22

Define $X_1$ : Batter A; $X_2$ : Batter B, $D_i = X_{1i} - X_{2i}$, for i = 1,...,6

$\bar{D} = \frac{0.006 + (-0.018) + (-0.014) + (-0.011) + (-0.004) + (-0.019)}{6} = -0.01$

$S_D = 0.00953$

### a.

1. $H_0 : \mu_1 - \mu_2 = D_0 = 0, H_a : \mu_1 - \mu_2 = D_0 \neq 0$


2. set $\alpha = 0.05$


3. Test statistic and its sampling distribution:

   $t_{STAT} = \frac{\bar{D} - D_0}{S_D / \sqrt{n}} \sim t_{n-1}$


4. Realized test statistic:

   $t^* = \frac{-0.01 - 0}{0.00953 / \sqrt{6}} = -2.570$


5. Rejection Region:

   $t_{n-1, \alpha / 2} = t_{5, 0.025} = 2.571$

   Therefore, the rejection region : $\\{t \mid t > 2.571 \text{ or } t < -2.571 \\}$


6. Because $t^* = -2.570 > -2.571$, which doesn't fall in the rejection region, we won't reject $H_0$

   The data don't present sufficient evidence to indicate a difference between the average densities of cakes prepared using the two types of batter.



### b.

The 95% confidence interval of $\mu_1 - \mu_2$ is:

$\bar{D} \pm t_{n-1, \alpha/2} \frac{S_D}{sqrt{n}}$

$(\mu_1 - \mu_2) \in -0.01 \pm t_{5, 0.025} \frac{0.00953}{\sqrt{6}} = (-0.020, 0.0000027)$

Because the C.I. includes 0, the data don't present sufficient evidence to indicate a difference between the average densities of cakes prepared using the two types of batter.
