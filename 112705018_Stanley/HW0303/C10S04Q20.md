## Solution to Question 17

Define $X_1$ : with imagery; $X_2$ : without imagery, $D_i = X_{1i} - X_{2i}$, for i = 1,...,20

$\bar{D} = \frac{15 + 15 + 15 + 9 + 16 + 8 + 12 + 8 + 10 + 12 + 9 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 17 + 13 + 4 + 7 +  7 + 10}{20} = 10.25$

$S_D = 4.051$

1. $H_0 : \mu_1 - \mu_2 = D_0 = 0, H_a : \mu_1 - \mu_2 = D_0 > 0$
   

2. set $\alpha = 0.05$


3. Test statistic and its sampling distribution:

   $t_{STAT} = \frac{\bar{D} - D_0}{S_D / \sqrt{n}} \sim t_{n-1}$


4. Realized test statistic:

   $t^* = \frac{10.25 - 0}{4.051 / sqrt{20}} = 11.316$


5. Rejection Region:

   $t_{n-1, \alpha} = t_{19, 0.05} = 1.729$

   Therefore, the rejection region : $\\{t \mid t > 1.729 \\}$


6. Because $t^* = 11.316 > 1.729$, which falls in the rejection region, we reject $H_0$

   We can conclude that the average recall score is higher when imagery is used.
