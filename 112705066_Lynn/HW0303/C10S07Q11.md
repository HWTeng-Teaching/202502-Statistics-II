## 1. Hypotheses
We define $\mu_d$ as the mean difference in reaction times between Stimulus 1 and Stimulus 2.

- $H_0: \mu_d = 0 \quad$

- $H_a: \mu_d \neq 0 \quad$


## 2. Significance Level
We set the significance level:

$$\alpha = 0.05$$

##  3. Test Statistic
Since the sample size is small $( n = 16 )$, we use the paired $t$-test formula:

$$t = \frac{\bar{d}}{s_d / \sqrt{n}}$$

where:
- $\bar{d}$ is the mean of the differences,
- $s_d$ is the standard deviation of the differences,
- $n$ is the number of paired observations.

## 4. Compute Test Statistic
We compute the differences:

$$
d_i = X_1 - X_2
$$

$$
(-3, 1, -1, -2, 1, -1, 0, -1, -1, -2, -2, -1, 2, -1, 0, -1)
$$

Calculate $\bar{d}$ and $s_d$:

$$
\bar{d} = \frac{\sum d_i}{n} = \frac{-13}{16} = -0.8125
$$

$$
s_d = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (d_i - \bar{d})^2}{n-1}}
$$

$$
s_d \approx 1.211
$$

$$
t = \frac{-0.8125}{1.211 / \sqrt{16}} = \frac{-0.8125}{0.3028} \approx -2.68
$$

## 5. p-value
Using a two-tailed $t$-test with $df = 15$, the critical value for $t_{0.025, 15}$ from the $t$-distribution table is:

$$
t_{critical} = \pm 2.131
$$

Since $|t| = 2.68$ > 2.131, we reject $H_0$.

Alternatively, using a p-value approach:

$$
p = P(T \leq -2.68) \times 2 \approx 0.016
$$

Since $p < \alpha$, we reject $H_0$.

## 6. Conclusion
At $\alpha = 0.05$, we reject $H_0$. There is sufficient evidence to conclude that the mean reaction times for the two stimuli are significantly different.
