# Dissolved Oâ‚‚ Content Analysis

A pollution control inspector suspects that a town is releasing semitreated sewage into a river. Dissolved oxygen readings (in ppm) were collected from five locations **above** and five locations **below** the town:

| Location  | Readings (ppm)      |
|-----------|--------------------|
| **Above Town** | 4.8, 5.2, 5.0, 4.9, 5.1 |
| **Below Town** | 5.0, 4.7, 4.9, 4.8, 4.9 |

## (a) Hypothesis Test: Is Oxygen Content Below Less than Above?

We perform a **one-tailed t-test** to check if the mean oxygen content **below** the town is significantly less than **above**.

### Step 1: Define Hypotheses
- **Null Hypothesis**: $$H_0: \mu_B = \mu_A$$ (No difference in mean oxygen content)
- **Alternative Hypothesis**: $$H_A: \mu_B < \mu_A$$ (Oxygen content below town is lower)

### Step 2: Compute Sample Statistics

#### Means:
$$
\bar{x}_A = \frac{4.8 + 5.2 + 5.0 + 4.9 + 5.1}{5} = 5.0
$$

$$
\bar{x}_B = \frac{5.0 + 4.7 + 4.9 + 4.8 + 4.9}{5} = 4.86
$$

#### Standard Deviations:
$$
s_A = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x}_A)^2}{n-1}} = 0.158
$$

$$
s_B = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x}_B)^2}{n-1}} = 0.114
$$

#### Pooled Standard Deviation:
$$
s_p = \sqrt{\frac{(n_A - 1)s_A^2 + (n_B - 1)s_B^2}{n_A + n_B - 2}}
$$

$$
s_p = \sqrt{\frac{(4)(0.158)^2 + (4)(0.114)^2}{8}} = 0.138
$$

### Step 3: Compute Test Statistic

$$
t = \frac{\bar{x}_A - \bar{x}_B}{s_p \sqrt{\frac{1}{n_A} + \frac{1}{n_B}}}
$$

$$
t = \frac{5.0 - 4.86}{0.138 \times \sqrt{\frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{5}}}
$$

$$
t = \frac{0.14}{0.087} = 1.61
$$

### Step 4: Critical Value and Decision

For a **one-tailed test** at $$\alpha = 0.05$$ with $$df = 8$$, the critical $$t$$-value is **1.86**.

Since **$$t = 1.61 < 1.86$$**, we **fail to reject $$H_0$$**. This means there is **not enough evidence** to conclude that the oxygen content below the town is significantly lower than above.

---

## (b) 95% Confidence Interval for Mean Difference

The confidence interval for the difference in means is:

$$
(\bar{x}_A - \bar{x}_B) \pm t_{\alpha/2} \cdot s_p \sqrt{\frac{1}{n_A} + \frac{1}{n_B}}
$$

Using $$t_{0.025, 8} = 2.31$$:

$$
(5.0 - 4.86) \pm (2.31)(0.138) \sqrt{\frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{5}}
$$

$$
0.14 \pm (2.31)(0.087)
$$

$$
0.14 \pm 0.20
$$

$$
(-0.06, 0.34)
$$

Since the interval includes **0**, there is **no significant difference** between the two locations at the 95% confidence level.

---

## Conclusion

- The hypothesis test **fails to show** that the oxygen level below the town is significantly lower.
- The confidence interval **supports** this, as it includes 0, meaning the difference is not statistically significant.
