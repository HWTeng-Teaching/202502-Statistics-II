### Step 1: Hypotheses

- **Null Hypothesis**: $H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2$ (No difference in means)
- **Alternative Hypothesis**: $H_a: \mu_1 \neq \mu_2$ (Significant difference)

### Step 2: Test Statistic

\[
t = \frac{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2}{\sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}}
\]

Substituting values:

\[
t = \frac{3.73 - 4.80}{\sqrt{\frac{2.78095}{15} + \frac{0.17143}{15}}}
\]

\[
t = \frac{-1.07}{\sqrt{0.1854 + 0.01143}}
\]

\[
t = \frac{-1.07}{\sqrt{0.19683}}
\]

\[
t = \frac{-1.07}{0.4435} \approx -2.41
\]

### Step 3: Degrees of Freedom (Welchâ€™s Approximation)

\[
df = \frac{\left(\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2} \right)^2}{\frac{(s_1^2 / n_1)^2}{n_1 - 1} + \frac{(s_2^2 / n_2)^2}{n_2 - 1}}
\]

Approximating, we get $df \approx 14$.

### Step 4: Critical Value

For a two-tailed test at $\alpha = 0.05$, the critical value for $t_{0.025, 14}$ is **approximately 2.145**.

### Step 5: Decision

Since $|t| = 2.41 > 2.145$, we **reject the null hypothesis**. This suggests that there is a significant difference in the number of uncontaminated eggplants between the two disinfectants.

## Conclusion

There is strong evidence that **20% bleach** is more effective than **95% ethanol** in preventing contamination in eggplant cuttings.
