a. 
Under normality assumption/ linear model assumption/ equal variance assumption, the regression analysis is valid.

b. 
best estimate of $\sigma^2$: $MSE$

$\sigma^2\approx MSE = 58.05$

c. 

- normality assumption: satisfied. Since the plot doesn't have strong curvature
- linear model assumption: satisfied. the plot doesn't have strong curvature & points are randomly scattered about the horizontal line at zero
- equal variance assumption: satisfied. vertical spread in the points in the plot are pretty much the same everywhere
