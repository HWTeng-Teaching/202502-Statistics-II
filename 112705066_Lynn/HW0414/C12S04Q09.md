a. 
$r^2=0.027$: 2.7% of the variance in orice can be interpreted the var of screen size

b. 
- Normality check (normal probability plot): The points fall roughly along the straight line (with slight deviation at the tails), so the residuals appear approximately normally distributed.

- Equal-variance check (residuals vs. fits plot): The spread of the residuals increases as the fitted values increase (a “fanning-out” pattern, with points forming two clusters), so the constant-variance assumption is clearly violated

c.

no linear trend so linear regression assumption is violated
