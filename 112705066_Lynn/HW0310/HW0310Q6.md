### **1. Sample sizes**
- $n_1 = 4$, so degrees of freedom: $df_1 = n_1 - 1 = 3$
- $n_2 = 3$, so degrees of freedom: $df_2 = n_2 - 1 = 2$
  
### **2. Rule of Thumb for Checking Variance Equality**
A common rule of thumb states that two variances can be considered approximately equal if the ratio:
$F = \frac{\text{Larger Variance}}{\text{Smaller Variance}}$
is **less than 3**.

### **3. Approximating the Significance Level**
The significance level can be estimated using the critical values of the F-distribution for $df_1 = 3$ and $df_2 = 2$.

From an F-table or calculator:
- For $\alpha = 0.10$, $F_{0.10, 3, 2} \approx 9.55$
- For $\alpha = 0.05$, $F_{0.05, 3, 2} \approx 19.16$
- For $\alpha = 0.01$, $F_{0.01, 3, 2} \approx 99.59$

Since the rule of thumb uses an approximate cutoff of 3, this corresponds roughly to an **alpha level between 0.20 and 0.30**.
