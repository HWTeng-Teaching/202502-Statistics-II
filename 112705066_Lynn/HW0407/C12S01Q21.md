Yes. The scatterplot with the fitted line (above) shows that the points lie fairly close to the straight line, with no obvious curvature or systematic pattern in the residuals. There is a bit more scatter at the smaller sizes, but overall the assumption of a linear relationship appears quite reasonable.
