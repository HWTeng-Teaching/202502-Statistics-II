## a. Scatterplot

overall shows a strong, roughly linear, positive association between armspan and height. As armspan increases, height tends to increase in almost a one‐for‐one fashion

Thus the relationship between the two variables is a strong, positive, linear relationship.

## b. slope
we expect the slope to be about 1 

## c. Least-squares regression line

$$
\sum x_i = 1328
$$

$$
\sum x_i^2 = 221016
$$

$$
\sum y_i = 1331
$$

$$
\sum y_i^2 = 224877
$$

$$
\sum x_i y_i = 221414
$$

---

$$
S_{xx} = 221016 - \frac{1328^2}{8} = 568
$$

$$
S_{xy} = 221414 - \frac{1328 \times 1331}{8} = 468
$$

$$
S_{yy} = 224877 - \frac{1331^2}{8} = 431.875
$$

---

$$
b = \frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}} = \frac{468}{568} = 0.824
$$

$$
\bar{x} = \frac{1328}{8} = 166
$$

$$
\bar{y} = \frac{1331}{8} = 166.375
$$

$$
a = \bar{y} - b \bar{x} = 166.375 - 0.824 \times 166 = 29.591
$$

---

**least-squares regression line：**

$$
y = 29.591 + 0.824 x
$$

---

$$
b = 0.824 \text{ smaller than 1, doesn't confirm that Da Vinci is correct}
$$

## d.

$$
y = 29.591 + 0.824 \times 157 = 158.959
$$

about 159
