The states can be regarded as our 4 treatments. 



We are given the following:

$$
\bar{x}_1 = 262.2 
$$
$$
\bar{x}_2 = 234.8 
$$
$$
\bar{x}_3 = 251.6 
$$
$$
\bar{x}_4 = 268.6
$$

Other values:

$$
MSE = 41.25
$$
$$
df = 16 
$$
$$
n_i = 5 
$$
$$
k = 4 
$$
$$
\alpha = 0.01
$$

---


$$
s = \sqrt{MSE} = \sqrt{41.25} = 6.422
$$

$$
SE = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n_i}} = \frac{6.422}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{6.422}{2.236} = 2.872
$$

---

### Step 2: Find the critical value $$q$$

From the studentized range distribution:

$$
q_{0.01}(4, 16) \approx 5.01
$$

---

$$
\omega = q \cdot SE = 5.01 \times 2.872 = 14.39
$$

---

Now compute absolute differences between sample means:

$$
|262.2 - 234.8| = 27.4 
$$
$$
|262.2 - 251.6| = 10.6 
$$
$$
|262.2 - 268.6| = 6.4 
$$
$$
|234.8 - 251.6| = 16.8 
$$
$$
|234.8 - 268.6| = 33.8 
$$
$$
|251.6 - 268.6| = 17.0
$$

Compare each to $$\omega = 14.39$$:

Significant differences (difference > $$\omega$$):

$$
\bar{x}_1 \text{ vs } \bar{x}_2 
$$
$$
\bar{x}_2 \text{ vs } \bar{x}_3 
$$
$$
\bar{x}_2 \text{ vs } \bar{x}_4 
$$
$$
\bar{x}_3 \text{ vs } \bar{x}_4
$$

Not significant:

$$
\bar{x}_1 \text{ vs } \bar{x}_3 
$$
$$
\bar{x}_1 \text{ vs } \bar{x}_4
$$

### Conclusion

At the $$\alpha = 0.01$$ level, the cost of lumber in **State 2** differs significantly from all other states. There are also significant differences between some other pairs.
