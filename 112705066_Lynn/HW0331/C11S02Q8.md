## **a. Construct the ANOVA Table**  

| Source   | DF  | Adj SS  | Adj MS  | F-Value |
|----------|---- |--------|--------|---------|
| Methods  | 2   | 641.88  | 320.94  | 5.148   |
| Error    | 8   | 498.665 | 62.333  |         |
| **Total**  | 10  | 1140.545 |        |         |

## **b. Hypothesis Test for Significant Difference**  

We perform an ANOVA test to determine if there is a significant difference in the average scores among the three methods.  

- **Null Hypothesis**:  
  $$H_0: \mu_A = \mu_B = \mu_C$$  
- **Alternative Hypothesis**:  
  $$H_a: \text{At least one mean is different}$$  

- **Significance Levels**:  
  - $$\alpha = 0.05$$  
  - $$\alpha = 0.01$$  

We reject $$H_0$$ if:  
$$F > F_{\alpha,2,8}$$  

From the ANOVA table:  
$$F = 5.148$$  

For $$\alpha = 0.05$$, the critical value:  
$$F_{0.05,2,8} = 4.46$$  
Since $$5.148 > 4.46$$, we **reject** $$H_0$$ at $$\alpha = 0.05$$.  

For $$\alpha = 0.01$$, the critical value:  
$$F_{0.01,2,8} = 8.65$$  

Since $$5.148 < 8.65$$, we **fail to reject** $$H_0$$ at $$\alpha = 0.01$$.  

### **Conclusion:**  
At $$\alpha = 0.05$$, we conclude that **at least one treatment method has a significantly different mean score, and there is a significant difference in the mean student scores as evident from our hypothesis test result**. However, at $$\alpha = 0.01$$, the evidence is insufficient to confirm a significant difference.
