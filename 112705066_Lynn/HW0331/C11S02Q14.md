## a. Construct the ANOVA Table  

| Source     | DF  | Adj SS | Adj MS | F-Value |
|------------|----|--------|--------|---------|
| Varieties  | 3  | 0.922  | 0.307  | 1.490   |
| Error      | 33 | 6.81   | 0.206  |         |
| **Total**  | 36 | 7.732  |        |         |

## b. Hypothesis Test for Significant Difference  

We perform an ANOVA test to determine if there is a significant difference in the average price among the four categories.  

- **Null Hypothesis**:  
  $$H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2 = \mu_3 = \mu_4$$  
- **Alternative Hypothesis**:  
  $$H_a: \text{At least one mean is different}$$  
- **Significance Levels**:  
  - $$\alpha = 0.05$$  
  - $$\alpha = 0.01$$  

We reject $$H_0$$ if:  
$$F > F_{\alpha,3,33}$$  

From the ANOVA table:  
$$F = 1.490$$  

For $$\alpha = 0.05$$, the critical value:  
$$F_{0.05,3,33} = 2.89$$  
Since $$1.490 < 2.89$$, we **fail to reject** $$H_0$$.  

For $$\alpha = 0.01$$, the critical value:  
$$F_{0.01,3,33} = 4.44$$  

Since $$1.490 < 4.44$$, we **fail to reject** $$H_0$$.  

### Conclusion:  
There is **no significant difference** in average price among the tuna varieties at both $$\alpha = 0.05$$ and $$\alpha = 0.01$$.

## c. 95% Confidence Interval for the Price Difference Between Light Tuna in Water and Light Tuna in Oil  

Given:  
- $$s = \sqrt{MSE} = 0.453$$  
- $$n_1 = 14, \quad n_4 = 11$$  
- $$\bar{x}_1 = 0.896, \quad \bar{x}_4 = 1.147$$  

Confidence Interval formula:  
$$
(\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_4) \pm t_{0.025,33} \cdot s \sqrt{\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_4}}
$$  

$$
(0.896 - 1.147) \pm 2.035 \times 0.206 \times \sqrt{\frac{1}{14} + \frac{1}{11}}
$$  

$$
-0.251 \pm 0.421
$$  

$$
(-0.714, 0.212)
$$  

### Conclusion:  
The confidence interval contains 0, so there is **no significant difference** between the prices of light tuna in water and light tuna in oil.

## d. 95% Confidence Interval for the Price Difference Between White Tuna in Water and White Tuna in Oil  

Given:  
- $$s = \sqrt{MSE} = 0.453$$  
- $$n_2 = 8, \quad n_3 = 4$$  
- $$\bar{x}_2 = 1.28, \quad \bar{x}_3 = 1.225$$  

Confidence Interval formula:  
$$
(\bar{x}_2 - \bar{x}_3) \pm t_{0.025,33} \cdot s \sqrt{\frac{1}{n_2} + \frac{1}{n_3}}
$$  

$$
(1.28 - 1.225) \pm 2.035 \times 0.206 \times \sqrt{\frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{4}}
$$  

$$
0.055 \pm 0.64
$$  

$$
(-0.585, 0.695)
$$  

### Conclusion:  
Since the confidence interval includes 0, there is **no significant difference** between the prices of white tuna in water and white tuna in oil.

## e. Other Confidence Intervals of Interest  

Other possible confidence intervals that might be of interest to the researcher:  

- **Light tuna in water vs. White tuna in water** $$ (\mu_1 - \mu_2) $$  
- **Light tuna in oil vs. White tuna in oil** $$ (\mu_4 - \mu_3) $$  
- **Pairwise comparisons of any two tuna types**  

These follow the same procedure as in (c) and (d).  

---

### Final Conclusion:  
- The ANOVA test shows **no significant difference** in average prices among the four tuna categories.  
- The confidence intervals confirm that **no individual pair has a statistically significant price difference**.  
- Further analysis could explore other pairwise comparisons or use a larger sample size for better precision.
