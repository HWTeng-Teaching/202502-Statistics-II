## Q24

**(a)**

- Blocks=Items: We expect the price of the same items to be roughly the same across the different stores. However, different items are not expect to have about the same price and thus we take the items as blocks.
- Treatment=Store


**(b)**  

The P-value of Store is given in the row "Store" and in the column "P" of the ANOVA table in the output:

$$
P = 0.000
$$

Let us assume that the significance level \(\alpha\) is 0.05. If the P-value is less than the significance level, then we reject the null hypothesis:

$$
P < 0.05 \Rightarrow \text{ Reject } H_0
$$

There is sufficient evidence to support the claim that there are significant differences in prices from store to store.

**(c)** 

By part (a), we know that the blocks are the items.

The P-value of Item is given in the row "Item" and in the column "P" of the ANOVA table in the output:

$$
P = 0.000
$$

Let us assume that the significance level 
α is 0.05. If the P-value is less than the significance level, then reject the null hypothesis.

$$
P < 0.05 \Rightarrow \text{ Reject } H_0
$$


There is sufficient evidence to support the claim that there are significant differences in prices from block to block. Blocking was effective, because we found differences in the prices from block to block.

## Q25

**(a)**
Given:

$$
k = \text{Number of groups} = 4
$$
$$
b = \text{Number of blocks} = 8
$$
$$
\bar{x}_1 = \text{Sample mean} = 4.1350
$$
$$
\bar{x}_2 = \text{Sample mean} = 4.3400
$$
$$
\bar{x}_3 = \text{Sample mean} = 3.8525
$$
$$
\bar{x}_4 = \text{Sample mean} = 2.5975
$$

(a) $$\ df_E \$$ is given in the row "Error" and in the column "df" of the ANOVA table in the MS Excel output.

$$
df_E = 21
$$

The value of $$q_{\alpha} (k, df)$$ is found in the row corresponding to $$df = df_E = 21$$. Since the table does not contain $$df = 21$$, we use the nearest degrees of freedom, $$df = 20 $$, instead. We then look in the column corresponding to $$k = 4$$ in the Percentage Points of Studentized Range Table in the appendix for the upper 5% points.

$$
q_{\alpha} (k, df) = 3.96
$$


**(b)**
Result part (a): $$q_{\alpha} (k, df) = 3.96$$

The $$MSE$$ is given in the row "Error" and in the column "MS" of the ANOVA table in the MS Excel output.

$$
MSE = 0.19157
$$

The pooled variance $$ s^2 $$ is estimated as $$ MSE $$ and thus the pooled standard deviation $$s$$ is estimated as the square root of the $$MSE$$.

$$
s = \sqrt{s^2} \approx \sqrt{MSE} = \sqrt{0.19157} \approx 0.4377
$$

We can then determine $$\omega = q_{\alpha} (k, df) \frac{s}{\sqrt{b}}$$:

$$
\omega = q_{\alpha} (k, df) \frac{s}{\sqrt{b}} = 3.96 \frac{0.4377}{\sqrt{8}} \approx 0.6128
$$

---

**(c)**

Result part (b): $$\omega = 0.6128$$

list the sample means from smallest to largest:

$$
\bar{x}_4 = 2.5975 \quad \bar{x}_3 = 3.8525 \quad \bar{x}_1 = 4.1350 \quad \bar{x}_2 = 4.3400
$$

If two sample means are within $$\omega = 0.6128$$ of each other, then the means are not significantly different, and we underline the pair of means.

$$
\underline{\bar{x}_4} \quad \underline{\bar{x}_3} \quad \underline{\bar{x}_1} \quad \underline{\bar{x}_2}
$$

The mean of the store Vons is significantly different from the mean of all other stores, while the other pairs of stores have no significantly different means.
