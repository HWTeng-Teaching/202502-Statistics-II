## (a) P-Value Analysis

The P-value is:

$$
P = 0.0251 = 2.51\%
$$

There is a 2.51% chance of obtaining the sample results of more extreme values when the population means are all equal.

and

$$
P = 0.0251 < 0.05 \Rightarrow \text{Reject } H_0
$$

There is sufficient evidence to support the claim that there is a difference in the mean assembly times for people trained by the three programs.

## (b) Mean Square Error (MSE)


$$
MSE = 14.941
$$

The sample variance \(s^2\) is estimated as \(MSE\), and thus the sample standard deviation \(s\) is estimated as the square root of the \(MSE\):

$$
s = \sqrt{s^2} \approx \sqrt{MSE} = \sqrt{14.941} \approx 3.8654
$$

Determine the t-value by looking in the row starting with degrees of freedom:

$$
df = n - k = 12 - 3 = 9
$$

and in the column with:

$$
\alpha = \frac{(1 - c)}{2} = 0.005
$$

From the Student’s T distribution table:

$$
t_{\alpha/2} = 3.250
$$

The margin of error is then:

$$
E = t_{\alpha/2} \cdot s \sqrt{\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2}} = 3.250 \cdot 3.8654 \sqrt{\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{3}} \approx 9.5948
$$

The endpoints of the confidence interval for \( \mu_1 - \mu_2 \) are:

$$
(\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2) - E = (60.5 - 54.667) - 9.5948 = 5.833 - 9.5948 = -3.7618
$$

$$
(\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2) + E = (60.5 - 54.667) + 9.5948 = 5.833 + 9.5948 = 15.4278
$$

We are 99% confident that the mean assembly time for people trained by program A is between 3.7618 lower and 15.4278 higher than the mean assembly time for people trained by program B.

## (c) Confidence Interval for Mean Assembly Time

$$
MSE = 14.941
$$

The sample variance \(s^2\) is estimated as \(MSE\), and thus the sample standard deviation \(s\) is estimated as the square root of \(MSE\):

$$
s = \sqrt{s^2} \approx \sqrt{MSE} = \sqrt{14.941} \approx 3.8654
$$

Determine the t-value using:

$$
df = n - k = 12 - 3 = 9
$$

and:

$$
\alpha = \frac{(1 - c)}{2} = 0.005
$$

From the Student’s T distribution table:

$$
t_{\alpha/2} = 3.250
$$

The margin of error is then:

$$
E = t_{\alpha/2} \times s \sqrt{\frac{1}{n_1}} = 3.250 \times 3.8654 \sqrt{\frac{1}{4}} \approx 6.2813
$$

The boundaries of the confidence interval then become:

$$
\bar{x} - E = 60.5 - 6.2813 = 54.2187
$$

$$
\bar{x} + E = 60.5 + 6.2813 = 66.7813
$$

We are 99% confident that the mean assembly times for people trained by program A are between 54.2187 and 66.7813.

## (d) Data Selection and Normality Assumption

We expect that the data will satisfy the conditions that the data are selected from normal populations because we have been given a sample number of data values for each group, and none of the data values appear to deviate strongly from the other data values in any group.



We are **99% confident** that the mean assembly times for a person trained by p
