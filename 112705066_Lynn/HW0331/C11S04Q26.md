## a
This is a Randomized Block Design with $$k=3$$ mixtures as our treatment and $$b=5$$ investigators as blocks and $$n=bk=15$$ observational units

Calculate the different sum of squares and proceed to form an ANOVA table for the RBD.

| Source       | DF  | SS     | MS     | F-Value |
|--------------|-----|--------|--------|---------|
| Mixture      | 2   | 107.2  | 53.6   | 11.05   |
| Investigator | 4   | 176.4  | 44.1   | 9.092   |
| Error        | 8   | 38.8   | 4.85   |         |
| **Total**    | 14  | 322.4  |        |         |

## b

To check whether there is sufficient evidence to conclude a significant difference in the propellant thrust for the mixture, we need to test the equality of the treatment means:

$$
H_0: \text{no difference of the treatment means} \quad \text{vs} \quad H_a: \text{one or more of the pairs differ}
$$

We reject $$H_0$$ if 

$$
F > F_{\alpha, k-1, (b-1)(k-1)} = F_{0.01, 2, 8} = 8.65
$$

Now, the observed F-value is:

$$
F = 11.05 > 8.65
$$

So, we *reject* the null hypothesis.

Additionally, the P-value is:

$$
P = 0.0099 \ll 0.05 = \alpha
$$

Therefore, we reject $$H_0$$ and successfully provide evidence to conclude a significant difference in the propellant thrust for the mixtures.


## c

To check whether there is sufficient evidence to conclude a significant variation from block to block (i.e., that blocking is effective), we need to test the equality of the block means:

$$
H_0: \text{no difference in the block means} \quad \text{vs} \quad H_a: \text{one or more of the pairs differ}
$$

We reject:

$$
H_0 \quad \text{if} \quad F > F_{\alpha, b-1, (b-1)(k-1)} = F_{0.01, 4, 8} = 7.01
$$

Now, the observed F-value is:

$$
F = 9.092 > 7.01
$$

So, we *reject* the null hypothesis.

Additionally, the P-value is:

$$
P = 0.0099 \ll 0.05 = \alpha
$$

Therefore, we reject:

$$
H_0
$$

and conclude that **blocking was effective**.

## d

From the previous part, we concluded that there is a significant difference in the three treatment means, and the difference exists in at least one pair.

Now, we apply **Tukey's method** for pairwise comparison. Two treatment means are judged to differ significantly if the corresponding sample means differ by at least:

$$
\omega
$$

Let the significance level be:

$$
\alpha = 0.01
$$

We are given:

$$
s = \sqrt{s^2} = \sqrt{MSE} = \sqrt{4.85} = 2.202
$$

Now, we compute the Tukey critical value:

$$
\omega = q_{\alpha}(k, df) \cdot \left(\frac{s}{\sqrt{b}}\right)
$$

Where:

$$
k = 3 \quad \text{(number of treatments)}
$$

$$
df = 8 \quad \text{(error degrees of freedom)}
$$

$$
b = 5 \quad \text{(number of blocks or replicates)}
$$

$$
q_{0.01}(2, 8) = 4.745
$$

So:

$$
\omega = 4.745 \times \left(\frac{2.202}{\sqrt{5}}\right) = 4.67
$$

$$
|\bar{x}_2 - \bar{x}_1| = |42.4 - 40.4| = 2 < 4.67 \Rightarrow \text{Not significant}
$$
$$
|\bar{x}_3 - \bar{x}_1| = |46.8 - 42.4| = 4.4 < 4.67 \Rightarrow \text{Not significant} 
$$
$$
|\bar{x}_3 - \bar{x}_1| = |46.8 - 40.4| = 6.4 > 4.67 \Rightarrow \textbf{Significant}
$$

**mixture 1** is significantly different from the **mixture 3**.
