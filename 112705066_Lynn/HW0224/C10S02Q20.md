# Cerebral Blood Flow Hypothesis Test

## Given Data:
- **Population Mean**: $\mu_0 = 74$
- **Sample Size**: $n = 25$
- **Sample Mean**: $\bar{x} = 69.7$
- **Sample Standard Deviation**: $s = 16$
- **Significance Level**: $\alpha = 0.05$

---

## Hypothesis Test:
### Hypotheses:
- **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)**: $\mu = 74$ (No difference in CBF)
- **Alternative Hypothesis ($H_a$)**: $\mu \neq 74$ (CBF is different)

### Test Statistic:
$$
t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{s / \sqrt{n}} = \frac{69.7 - 74}{16 / \sqrt{25}} = -1.344
$$

### Decision:
- **Critical $t$-value** (two-tailed, $df = 24$): $\pm 2.064$
- Since $t_{\text{stat}} = -1.344$ is within $(-2.064, 2.064)$, **fail to reject $H_0$**.

### Conclusion:
There is **not enough evidence** to conclude that the average CBF for stroke patients is different from that of healthy individuals at $\alpha = 0.05$.
