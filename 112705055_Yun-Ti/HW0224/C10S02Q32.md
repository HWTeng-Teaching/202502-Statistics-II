## Solution
a.
1. 95% C.I. for $\mu$:(0,9867, 1.1178). Mean=1.5022 matches the given confidence interval, so we do not reject $H_0$. The weights of packages of ground beef in a supermarket meat display is 1.
2. T-value: $t_{26;0.025}=2.056$, R.R.:{t>2.056 or t<-2.056}. $t^*=1.64<2.056$ and it is not in the rejection region so does not reject $H_0$. The weights of packages of ground beef in a supermarket meat display is 1.
3. P-value=0.113> $\alpha = 0.05$, it does not reject $H_0$. The weights of packages of ground beef in a supermarket meat display is 1.

b.n=27, $\bar{x}=1.0522$, s=0.1657, $\mu_0=1$, $\alpha=0.05$
1. T-value: $t^*= \frac{\bar{x} - 1}{s / \sqrt{n}} = \frac{1.0522 - 1}{0.1657 / \sqrt{27}}=1.6369 \approx 1.64$
2. C.I.: $\bar{X}\pm t_{26;0.025}\cdot \frac{0.1657}{\sqrt{27}} =1.0522 \pm 2.056 \cdot \frac{0.1657}{\sqrt{27}}=(0.9867, 1.1178)$
