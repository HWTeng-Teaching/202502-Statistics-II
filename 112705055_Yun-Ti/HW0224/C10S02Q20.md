## Solution
1. $H_0:\mu =74$, $H_a:\mu\neq74$
2. Set $\alpha=0.05$
3. $t_{STAT}=\frac{\bar{X}-74}{S/\sqrt{n}}\sim t_{24}$
4. $t^*=\frac{69.7-74}{16/\sqrt{25}}=-1.34375$
5. $t_{24;0.025}=2.064$, R.R.={t>2.064 or t<-2.064}
6. $\because$ $t^*=-1.34375 > -2.064$ and it is not in rejection region, it is not reject. There is insufficient evidence to indicate the average CBF for stroke patients is different from that of healty people.
