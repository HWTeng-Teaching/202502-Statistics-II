## Q24:

**(a)**
- Treatment: Store
- Blocks: Items



**(b)**  

The P-value of Store is given in the ANOVA table:

$$
P = 0.000
$$

Assume that the significance level $\alpha =$ 0.05. If the P-value is less than the significance level, then we reject the null hypothesis:

$$
P < 0.05 \Rightarrow \text{ Reject } H_0
$$

There is sufficient evidence to support the claim that there are significant differences in prices from store to store.

**c.**

By part (a), we know that the blocks are the items.

The P-value of Item is given in the ANOVA table :

$$
P = 0.000
$$

Assume that the significance level 
Î± = 0.05. If the P-value is less than the significance level, then reject the null hypothesis.

$$
P < 0.05 \Rightarrow \text{ Reject } H_0
$$


There is sufficient evidence to support the claim that there are significant differences in prices from block to block. Blocking was effective, because we found differences in the prices from block to block.

## Q25:

**(a)**
Given:

$$
k = \text{Number of groups} = 4
$$
$$
b = \text{Number of blocks} = 8
$$

(a) $df_E$ is given in the ANOVA table in the MS Excel output.

$$
df_E = 21
$$

$$
\alpha = 0.05
$$

$$
q_{\alpha} (k, df) = 3.96
$$


**(b)**
Result part (a): $$q_{\alpha} (k, df) = 3.96$$

The $MSE$ is given in the ANOVA table in the MS Excel output.

$$
MSE = 0.1658
$$

$$
s = \sqrt{s^2} \approx \sqrt{MSE} = \sqrt{0.1658} \approx 0.4072
$$


$$
\omega = q_{\alpha} (k, df) \frac{s}{\sqrt{b}} = 3.96 \frac{0.4072}{\sqrt{8}} \approx 0.57
$$

---

**c.**

Result part (b): $$\omega = 0.57$$

list the sample means from smallest to largest:

$$
\bar{x}_4 = 2.68125 < \bar{x}_2 = 3.8525 < \bar{x}_3 = 4.135 < \bar{x}_1 = 4.34
$$

If two sample means are within $\omega = 0.57$ of each other, then the means are not significantly different.

$$
{\bar{x}_4} \quad \underline{\bar{x}_2} \quad \underline{\bar{x}_3} \quad \underline{\bar{x}_1}
$$

The mean of the store WinCo is significantly different from the mean of all other stores, while the other pairs of stores have no significantly different means.
