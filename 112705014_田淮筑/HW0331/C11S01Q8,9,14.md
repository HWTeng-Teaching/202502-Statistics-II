## Solution

## 8. Factors and Levels
 **Factor**: Type of fertilizer
 **Levels**: Fertilizer A, Fertilizer B, Fertilizer C (3 types in total)

## 9. Factors and Levels
 **Factor**: Dosage of vitamin C
 **Levels**: 200 mg, 500 mg, 1000 mg (3 levels)



## 14. Normality
We would **not be willing to assume normality** for the data described in Exercise 14 because:
The data consists of **proportions** (i.e., binomial outcomes), which are bounded between 0 and 1.
With only 25 days of data and proportions coming from a count of 100 items, the distribution is likely **not symmetric**.
Proportions tend to be **skewed**, especially when close to 0 or 1, making the assumption of normality inappropriate.

Thus, the normality assumption is likely violated for the proportion of defective items over 25 days.
