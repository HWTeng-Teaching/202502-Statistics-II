##Solution

## (a) P-Value Analysis

The P-value is:

$$
P = 0.0251
$$

There is a 2.51% chance of obtaining the sample results or more extreme values if all population means are equal.

$$
P = 0.0251 < 0.05 \Rightarrow \text{Reject } H_0
$$

There is sufficient evidence to support the claim that there is a difference in the mean assembly times for people trained by the three programs.

## (b) 99% Confidence Interval (Program A vs. Program B)

$$
MSE = 14.941
$$

$$
s = \sqrt{MSE} = \sqrt{14.941} \approx 3.8654
$$

Degrees of freedom:

$$
df = 12 - 3 = 9
$$

Significance level:

$$
\alpha = 0.01 \Rightarrow \alpha/2 = 0.005
$$

From t-table:

$$
t_{\alpha/2,9} = 3.25
$$

Margin of error:

$$
E = t_{\alpha/2} \cdot s \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2}} = 3.25 \cdot 3.8654 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{3}} \approx 9.5948
$$

Confidence interval:

$$
(\bar{x}_A - \bar{x}_B) \pm E = (60.5 - 54.667) \pm 9.5948
$$

$$
= 5.833 \pm 9.5948 \Rightarrow (-3.7618, 15.4278)
$$

We are 99% confident that the mean difference in assembly time between program A and B lies between -3.7618 and 15.4278 minutes.

## (c) 99% Confidence Interval for Mean of Program A

$$
MSE = 14.941, \quad s = \sqrt{14.941} \approx 3.8654
$$

$$
t_{\alpha/2,9} = 3.25
$$

$$
E = t_{\alpha/2} \cdot s \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1}{n_1}} = 3.25 \cdot 3.8654 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1}{4}} \approx 6.2813
$$

Confidence interval for $\bar{x}_A = 60.5$:

$$
60.5 \pm 6.2813 = (54.2187, 66.7813)
$$

We are 99% confident that the mean assembly time for people trained by program A is between 54.2187 and 66.7813 minutes.

## (d) Normality Assumption

We can reasonably assume the data were sampled from approximately normal populations because:
- The number of observations per group is small but not extremely low.
- No extreme outliers or large deviations are observed.
- ANOVA is robust to moderate deviations from normality, especially when group sizes are similar.
