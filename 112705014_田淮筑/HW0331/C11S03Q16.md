## **a. ANOVA Table**   

| Source   | DF  | Adj SS  | Adj MS  | F-Value |
|----------|-----|---------|---------|---------|
| Methods  | 2   | 641.88  | 320.94  | 5.15    |
| Error    | 8   | 498.665 | 62.333  |         |
| **Total**| 10  | 1140.545|         |         |

## **b. Hypothesis Test for Significant Difference**  

- **Null Hypothesis**:  
  $$H_0: \mu_A = \mu_B = \mu_C$$  
- **Alternative Hypothesis**:  
  $$H_a: \text{At least one mean is different}$$  

- **Significance Level**:  
  $$\alpha = 0.05$$  

We reject $H_0$ if:  
$$F > F_{0.05,2,8}$$  

From the ANOVA table:  
$$F = 5.15$$  

Critical value at $\alpha = 0.05$:  
$$F_{0.05,2,8} = 4.46$$  
Since $5.15 > 4.46$, we **reject** $H_0$ at $\alpha = 0.05$.  

### **Conclusion:**  
At $\alpha = 0.05$, there is a significant difference in the mean student scores among the treatment methods.

## **c. Tukey's HSD for Lumber Costs at $\alpha = 0.01$**

$$
s = \sqrt{MSE} = \sqrt{41.25} = 6.422
$$

$$
SE = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n_i}} = \frac{6.422}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{6.422}{2.236} = 2.872
$$

$$
q_{0.01}(4, 16) \approx 5.19
$$

---

$$
\omega = q \cdot SE = 5.19 \times 2.872 = 14.906
$$

---

Now compute absolute differences between sample means:

$$
\bar{x}_2 < \bar{x}_3 < \bar{x}_1 < \bar{x}_4
$$

$$
|251.6 - 234.8 | = 16.8 
$$
$$
|262.2 - 251.6| = 10.6 
$$
$$
|268.6 - 262.2| = 6.4 
$$

Compare each to $\omega = 14.906$:

**state 2** is significantly different from all other.  
**state 3** is significantly different from the mean cost in **state 4**.
