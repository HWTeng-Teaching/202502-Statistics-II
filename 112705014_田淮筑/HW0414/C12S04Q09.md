#### a.

r=Only 2.7%, which indicates a very weak linear relationship between the two variables.

#### b.

In the normal probability plot, the residuals deviate from the straight line, especially at the ends, which indicates that the normality assumption is violated.
In the residuals versus fitted plot, the residuals do not spread out evenly around y = 0, suggesting a violation of the equal variance assumption.
Therefore, both normality and equal variance assumptions are violated.

#### c.

The scatterplot does not show a linear trend between screen size and price, so the linearity assumption is violated.
