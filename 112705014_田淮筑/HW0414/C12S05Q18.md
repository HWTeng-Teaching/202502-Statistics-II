Yes, the data points show a positive linear trend â€” as the amount of phosphorus applied increases, the phosphorus in the plant also tends to increase.

#### b.

$\hat{y} = 80.9 + 270.8x$  

#### c.

$H_0: \quad b = 0$  
$H_a: \quad b \neq 0$  

set $\alpha = 0.05$

p-value = 0.003 < 0.05  -->>reject $\quad H_0$  

answer
Yes, because the p-value (0.003) is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis.
There is sufficient evidence that the amount of phosphorus in the plant is linearly related to the amount applied to the soil.
the data provide sufficient evidence to indicate that the amount of phosphorus present in the plant is linearly related to the amount of phosphorus applied to the soil  

#### d.

90% CI

$(112.130, 157.900)$
