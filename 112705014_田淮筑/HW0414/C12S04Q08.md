#### a.
   

(1) The relationship between x and y is linear. $y = \alpha + \beta x + \epsilon$  

(2) The random errors term $\epsilon$ are independent.

(3) The random errors have a mean of 0 and a constant variance $\sigma^2$.

(4) The random errors are normally distributed.

#### b.

58.05

#### c.

In the normal probability plot, the residuals deviate from the line at the tails, indicating that the residuals are not normally distributed.
In the residuals versus fits plot, the residuals do not scatter randomly around zero, suggesting a violation of the equal variance assumption.
