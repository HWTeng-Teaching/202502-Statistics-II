#### a.

Since we want to predict calories based on total fat, we should use linear regression analysis instead of correlation analysis.
Regression allows us to determine how calories change with fat, not just whether they move together.

#### b.

total fat as independent variable, x, and calories as dependent variable, y  

$$
r = 0.9190
$$

$H_0: \quad \rho = 0$  
$H_a: \quad \rho \neq 0$  

$\alpha = 0.05$  

use the t statistic  

$$
t_{STAT} = r \times \sqrt{\frac{n-2}{1-r^2}} \sim t_{n-2}
$$

$$
t^* = 0.9190 \times \sqrt{\frac{5}{1-0.9190^2}} = 5.2122
$$

the critical value  

$$
t_{5,0.025} = 2.571
$$

 5.2122 > 2.571  
 reject $\quad H_0$  


The correlation between total fat and calories is strong and positive, with 
𝑟=0.919
r=0.919 and a p-value of 0.0034.
This means that as the amount of fat increases, the number of calories also increases significantly.
The relationship is linear and statistically significant.
