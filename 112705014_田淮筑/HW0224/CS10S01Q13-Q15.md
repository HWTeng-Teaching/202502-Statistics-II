## Problem 13

### Solution
The normal probability plot in Problem 13 shows that the data points closely follow the straight line, with only minor deviations. This suggests that the data is approximately normally distributed. The lack of significant curvature or large deviations indicates that the assumption of normality is reasonable.

## Problem 14

### Solution
The normal probability plot in Problem 14 displays noticeable curvature, with data points deviating significantly from the straight line, particularly in the lower and upper tails. This suggests that the data does not follow a normal distribution and may have skewness or other non-normal characteristics.

## Problem 15

### Solution
The boxplot in Problem 15 appears symmetric, with the median centered within the interquartile range (IQR) and whiskers extending roughly equally on both sides. There are no extreme outliers, which suggests that the data may be normally distributed. However, boxplots alone do not confirm normality, so additional analysis (such as a normal probability plot) is needed for a more definitive conclusion.
