## Solution
Step 1: Define Hypotheses

$$H_0:\mu = 74, \quad H_a: \mu \neq 74$$

Step 2: Identify the $\alpha$

$$\alpha=0.05$$
  
Step 3: Compute the Test Statistic and its sampling distribution is  

$$t_{\text{STAT}} = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{s / \sqrt{n}} \sim t_{(n - 1)}$$\
$$t_{\text{STAT}} = \frac{\bar{x} - 74}{s / \sqrt{n}} \sim t_{24}$$
     
Step 4: Calculate the realized statistics

$$
t^* = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{s / \sqrt{n}} = \frac{69.7 - 74}{16 / \sqrt{25}} = -1.34375
$$
     
Step 5: Find the rejection region\

Since this is a  two-tailed test with $\alpha=0.05$ and df = 25-1 = 24


$$
t_{24;0.025}=2.064. \
$$

$$
\text{Reject } H_0  \text{when }  t < -2.064 \text{ or } t > 2.064
$$
     
Step 6: Conclusion
   
$$\text{t = -1.34375 > -2.064}$$

$$\text{Non-Reject }H_0$$

$$\text{There is not enough evidence to conclude that the average cerebral blood flow (CBF) for stroke patients is significantly different from that of healthy individuals.}$$
