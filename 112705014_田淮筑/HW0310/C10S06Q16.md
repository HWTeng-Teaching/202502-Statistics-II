## Solution

We perform an **F-test for equality of variances** to determine if the assumption of equal variances holds for a pooled two-sample t-test.

- **Null Hypothesis**:  $H_0: \sigma_1^2 = \sigma_2^2$ (The variances are equal)
- **Alternative Hypothesis**: $H_a: \sigma_1^2 \neq \sigma_2^2$ (The variances are different)

Given sample data:

$$
\bar{x}_1 = 784, \quad \bar{x}_2 = 758
$$

$$
s_1 = 114, \quad s_2 = 103, \quad n_1 = 15, \quad n_2 = 15
$$

### Step 1: Compute F-Statistic

The test statistic for an F-test is:

$$
F = \frac{s_1^2}{s_2^2}
$$

Substituting values:

$$
F = \frac{(114)^2}{(103)^2} = \frac{12996}{10609} \approx 1.225
$$

### Step 2: Determine P-Value

Degrees of freedom:

$$
df_1 = n_1 - 1 = 15 - 1 = 14, \quad df_2 = n_2 - 1 = 15 - 1 = 14
$$

Using an F-table or calculator, the critical values for **$F_{0.025, 14, 14}$** and **$F_{0.975, 14, 14}$** are approximately **0.398** and **2.50**, respectively.

Since **$1.225$ is between $0.398$ and $2.50$**, the p-value is **greater than 0.10**.

### Step 3: Conclusion

Since the p-value is large, we **fail to reject $H_0$**. There is **insufficient evidence** to conclude that the variances are different, meaning the assumption of equal variances for the pooled t-test is reasonable.
