## Solution

We perform an **F-test for equality of variances** to determine if the variability in stock prices differs significantly between the two stocks.

- **Null Hypothesis**:  $H_0: \sigma_1^2 = \sigma_2^2$ (The variances are equal)
- **Alternative Hypothesis**: $H_a: \sigma_1^2 \neq \sigma_2^2$ (The variances are different)

Given sample data:

$$
\bar{x}_1 = 40.33, \quad \bar{x}_2 = 42.54
$$

$$
s_1^2 = 1.54, \quad s_2^2 = 2.96, \quad n_1 = 15, \quad n_2 = 15
$$

### Step 1: Compute F-Statistic

The test statistic for an F-test is:

$$
F = \frac{s_2^2}{s_1^2}
$$

Substituting values:

$$
F = \frac{2.96}{1.54} \approx 1.92
$$

### Step 2: Determine P-Value

Degrees of freedom:

$$
df_1 = n_2 - 1 = 15 - 1 = 14, \quad df_2 = n_1 - 1 = 15 - 1 = 14
$$

Using an F-table or calculator, the critical values for **$F_{0.005, 14, 14}$** and **$F_{0.995, 14, 14}$** are approximately **0.326** and **3.29**, respectively.

Since **$1.92$ is within this range**, the p-value is **greater than 0.01**.

### Step 3: Conclusion

Since the p-value is large, we **fail to reject $H_0$**. There is **insufficient evidence** to conclude that the variances are different, meaning the variability in stock prices is not significantly different between the two stocks.

### b. 99% Confidence Interval for Ratio of Population Variances

The confidence interval for the ratio of variances is given by:

$$
\left( \frac{s_2^2}{s_1^2} \times \frac{1}{F_{\alpha/2, df_2, df_1}}, \frac{s_2^2}{s_1^2} \times F_{1-\alpha/2, df_1, df_2} \right)
$$

Substituting values:

$$
\left( \frac{2.96}{1.54} \times \frac{1}{3.29}, \frac{2.96}{1.54} \times 3.29 \right)
$$

$$
\left( 1.92 \times 0.304, 1.92 \times 3.29 \right)
$$

$$
(0.58, 6.31)
$$

Thus, the **99% confidence interval** for the ratio of population variances is **(0.58, 6.31)**.
