## Solution

### a. Compute Mean and Standard Deviation

The mean of a dataset is given by:

$$
\bar{x} = \frac{\sum x_i}{n}
$$

The standard deviation is computed as:

$$
s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}}
$$

#### Number of Completions

Given data:

$$
(28, 22, 20, 18, 31, 27, 20, 21, 17, 15, 25, 21, 22, 20, 31, 22)
$$

Computing:

$$
\bar{x} \approx 22.31, \quad s \approx 4.89
$$

#### Yards per Pass

Given data:

$$
(13.8, 13.2, 11.4, 17.7, 11.1, 16.1, 12.6, 17.2, 12.5, 12.2, 10.7, 12.3, 15.8, 11.8, 10.7, 8.7)
$$

Computing:

$$
\bar{x} \approx 12.61, \quad s \approx 2.56
$$

### b. 95% Confidence Interval for Variance of Completions

The confidence interval for variance is given by:

$$
\left( \frac{(n-1)s^2}{\chi^2_{\alpha/2, n-1}}, \frac{(n-1)s^2}{\chi^2_{1-\alpha/2, n-1}} \right)
$$

Substituting values:

$$
\left( \frac{(15)(4.89^2)}{26.296}, \frac{(15)(4.89^2)}{6.262} \right)
$$

$$
(9.1, 48.4)
$$

Since lower variability is preferred for performance consistency, a smaller variance in completions would indicate more stable passing ability.

### c. 95% Confidence Interval for Variance and Standard Deviation of Yards per Pass

For variance:

$$
\left( \frac{(15)(2.56^2)}{26.296}, \frac{(15)(2.56^2)}{6.262} \right)
$$

$$
(0.94, 5.02)
$$

For standard deviation:

$$
(\sqrt{0.94}, \sqrt{5.02})
$$

$$
(0.97, 2.24)
$$

### d. Hypothesis Test for Standard Deviation of Yards per Pass

#### Hypotheses:

$$
H_0: \sigma = 4, \quad H_a: \sigma \neq 4
$$

Test statistic:

$$
\chi^2 = \frac{(n-1)s^2}{\sigma^2}
$$

$$
= \frac{(15)(2.56^2)}{4^2} = 6.14
$$

Critical values for $\alpha = 0.05$ and $df = 15$:

$$
\chi^2_{0.025,15} = 6.262, \quad \chi^2_{0.975,15} = 26.296
$$

Since **$6.14$ is within $(6.262, 26.296)$**, we **fail to reject $H_0$**, meaning there is no sufficient evidence to suggest the standard deviation differs from 4.
