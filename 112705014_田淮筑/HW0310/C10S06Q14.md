## Solution

We perform an **F-test for equality of variances** to determine if the variability in daily production differs significantly between the two fabricating systems.

- **Null Hypothesis**:  $H_0: \sigma_1^2 = \sigma_2^2$ (The variances are equal)
- **Alternative Hypothesis**: $H_a: \sigma_1^2 < \sigma_2^2$ (The variance of the old system is greater)

Given sample data:

$$
\bar{x}_1 = 246, \quad \bar{x}_2 = 240
$$

$$
s_1 = 15.6, \quad s_2 = 28.2, \quad n_1 = 30, \quad n_2 = 30
$$

### Step 1: Compute F-Statistic

The test statistic for an F-test is:

$$
F = \frac{s_2^2}{s_1^2}
$$

Substituting values:

$$
F = \frac{(28.2)^2}{(15.6)^2} = \frac{795.24}{243.36} \approx 3.27
$$

### Step 2: Determine P-Value

Degrees of freedom:

$$
df_1 = n_2 - 1 = 30 - 1 = 29, \quad df_2 = n_1 - 1 = 30 - 1 = 29
$$

Using an F-table or calculator, the critical value for $F_{0.05, 29, 29}$ is approximately **2.39**.

Since **$F = 3.27 > 2.39$**, the p-value is **less than 0.05**.

### Step 3: Conclusion

Since the p-value is less than 0.05, we **reject $H_0$**. There is sufficient evidence to conclude that the variability in daily production is significantly greater for the older fabricating system. This suggests that increased maintenance for the older system may be warranted.
