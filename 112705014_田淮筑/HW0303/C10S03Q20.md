## Solution

We perform a **two-sample t-test** to determine if the mean dissolved oxygen content below the town is significantly lower than that above the town.

- **Null Hypothesis**:  $H_0: \mu_{\text{below}} = \mu_{\text{above}}$ (No difference in mean oxygen content)
- **Alternative Hypothesis**: $H_a: \mu_{\text{below}} < \mu_{\text{above}}$ (Oxygen content below town is lower)

### Step 1: Compute Sample Statistics

#### Above Town
Mean:
$$
\bar{x}_{\text{above}} = \frac{4.8 + 5.2 + 5.0 + 4.9 + 5.1}{5} = 5.00
$$

Standard Deviation:
$$
s_{\text{above}} \approx 0.1581
$$

#### Below Town
Mean:
$$
\bar{x}_{\text{below}} = \frac{5.0 + 4.7 + 4.9 + 4.8 + 4.9}{5} = 4.86
$$

Standard Deviation:
$$
s_{\text{below}} \approx 0.1140
$$

### Step 2: Compute Test Statistic

Assuming equal variances, the **pooled standard deviation** is:
$$
s_p = \sqrt{\frac{(n_1-1)s_1^2 + (n_2-1)s_2^2}{n_1+n_2-2}}
$$

$$
s_p \approx 0.1378
$$

The **t-statistic** is:
$$
t = \frac{\bar{x}_{\text{below}} - \bar{x}_{\text{above}}}{s_p \sqrt{\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2}}}
$$

$$
t = \frac{4.86 - 5.00}{0.1378 \times 0.6325} \approx -1.61
$$

### Step 3: Critical Value and Conclusion

For a **one-tailed** test with $df = 8$ and $\alpha = 0.05$, the critical $t$-value is:
$$
t_{0.05,8} \approx -1.86
$$

Since **$t = -1.61 > -1.86$**, we **fail to reject $H_0$**.

### Conclusion
There is **insufficient evidence** to conclude that the mean dissolved oxygen content below the town is less than that above the town.

---

## (b) 95% Confidence Interval for Difference in Means

Using the formula:
$$
(\bar{x}_{\text{below}} - \bar{x}_{\text{above}}) \pm t_{\alpha/2} \cdot s_p \sqrt{\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2}}
$$

Substituting values:
$$
(-0.14) \pm (2.306) (0.1378 \times 0.6325)
$$

$$
= -0.14 \pm 0.201
$$

Thus, the **95% confidence interval** is:
$$
(-0.341, 0.061)
$$

Since the interval contains 0, it further confirms that there is **no significant difference** in dissolved oxygen levels between the two locations.
