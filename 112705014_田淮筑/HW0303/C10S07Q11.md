## Solution

We perform a **paired t-test** to determine if there is a significant difference in reaction times between the two stimuli.

- **Null Hypothesis**:  $H_0: \mu_d = 0$ (No difference in mean reaction times)
- **Alternative Hypothesis**: $H_a: \mu_d \neq 0$ (A difference exists in reaction times)

Where $d = \text{Stimulus 2} - \text{Stimulus 1}$.

### Step 1: Compute Differences $d$

For each participant, we calculate:

$$
d_i = X_{\text{Stimulus 2}, i} - X_{\text{Stimulus 1}, i}
$$

The computed differences are:

$$
(3, -1, -1, 1, 2, -1, 1, 1, -1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1)
$$

### Step 2: Compute Mean and Standard Deviation of Differences

Mean of the differences:

$$
\bar{d} = \frac{\sum d_i}{n} = \frac{3 - 1 - 1 + 1 + 2 - 1 + 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1}{16} = 0.625
$$

Standard deviation:

$$
s_d = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (d_i - \bar{d})^2}{n-1}}
$$

$$
s_d \approx 1.087
$$

### Step 3: Compute Test Statistic

The paired **t-test statistic** is:

$$
t = \frac{\bar{d}}{s_d / \sqrt{n}}
$$

$$
t = \frac{0.625}{1.087 / \sqrt{16}} = \frac{0.625}{0.2718} \approx 2.3
$$

### Step 4: Determine Critical Value

Degrees of freedom:

$$
df = n - 1 = 16 - 1 = 15
$$

For a **two-tailed** test at $\alpha = 0.05$, the critical value $t_{0.025,15} \approx 2.131$.

### Step 5: Conclusion

Since **$t = 2.3 > 2.131$**, we **reject $H_0$**. There is sufficient evidence to conclude a difference in reaction times between the two stimuli.
