## Solution

We perform a **paired t-test** to determine if there is a significant difference in the densities of cakes prepared with two different batters.

- **Null Hypothesis**:  $H_0: \mu_d = 0$ (No difference in densities between the two batters)
- **Alternative Hypothesis**: $H_a: \mu_d \neq 0$ (A difference exists between the two batters)

Where $d = \text{Batter B} - \text{Batter A}$.

### Step 1: Compute Differences $d$

For each location, we calculate:

$$
d_i = X_{\text{Batter B}, i} - X_{\text{Batter A}, i}
$$

The computed differences are:

$$
(-0.006, 0.018, 0.014, 0.011, 0.004, 0.019)
$$

### Step 2: Compute Mean and Standard Deviation of Differences

Mean of the differences:

$$
\bar{d} = \frac{\sum d_i}{n} = \frac{-0.006 + 0.018 + 0.014 + 0.011 + 0.004 + 0.019}{6} = 0.01
$$

Standard deviation:

$$
s_d = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (d_i - \bar{d})^2}{n-1}}
$$

$$
s_d \approx 0.0109
$$

### Step 3: Compute Test Statistic

The paired **t-test statistic** is:

$$
t = \frac{\bar{d}}{s_d / \sqrt{n}}
$$

$$
t = \frac{0.01}{0.0109 / \sqrt{6}} = \frac{0.01}{0.00445} \approx 2.25
$$

### Step 4: Determine Critical Value

Degrees of freedom:

$$
df = n - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5
$$

For a **two-tailed** test at $\alpha = 0.05$, the critical value $t_{0.025,5} \approx 2.571$.

### Step 5: Conclusion

Since **$t = 2.25 < 2.571$**, we **fail to reject $H_0$**. There is **insufficient evidence** to conclude a difference in densities between the two batters.

---

### Confidence Interval for Mean Difference

The **95% confidence interval** for $\mu_d$ is:

$$
\bar{d} \pm t_{\alpha/2, n-1} \cdot \frac{s_d}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

Substituting values:

$$
0.01 \pm (2.571) \times \frac{0.0109}{\sqrt{6}}
$$

$$
0.01 \pm (2.571) \times (0.00445)
$$

$$
0.01 \pm 0.0114
$$

Thus, the **95% confidence interval** is:

$$
(-0.0014, 0.0214)
$$

Since the interval contains 0, it further confirms that there is **no significant difference** in densities between the two batters.
