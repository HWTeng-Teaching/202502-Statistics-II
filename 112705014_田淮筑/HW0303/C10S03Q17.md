### Solution

#### (a) Assessing Equal Variances
We use the ratio of the variances to assess equality:

$$
F = \frac{\text{larger variance}}{\text{smaller variance}} = \frac{2.78095}{0.17143} \approx 16.22
$$

Since this ratio is significantly greater than 1, we conclude that the variances are not equal. Hence, we do not assume equal variances.

#### (b) Hypothesis Test for Mean Difference

##### Step 1: Define Hypotheses

$$
H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2 \quad \text{(no difference in mean effectiveness)}
$$

$$
H_a: \mu_1 \neq \mu_2 \quad \text{(significant difference in mean effectiveness)}
$$

##### Step 2: Test Statistic
Since the variances are not equal, we use the unequal variance $t$-test (Welchâ€™s $t$-test):

$$
t = \frac{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2}{\sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}}
$$

Substituting the values:

$$
t = \frac{3.73 - 4.80}{\sqrt{\frac{2.78095}{15} + \frac{0.17143}{15}}}
$$

$$
t = \frac{-1.07}{\sqrt{0.1854 + 0.0114}} = \frac{-1.07}{\sqrt{0.1968}} = \frac{-1.07}{0.4436} \approx -2.41
$$

##### Step 3: Degrees of Freedom

Using Welch-Satterthwaite equation:

$$
df = \frac{\left( \frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2} \right)^2}{\frac{(s_1^2 / n_1)^2}{n_1 - 1} + \frac{(s_2^2 / n_2)^2}{n_2 - 1}}
$$

Substituting values:

$$
df = \frac{(0.1854 + 0.0114)^2}{\frac{(0.1854)^2}{14} + \frac{(0.0114)^2}{14}}
$$

$$
df \approx \frac{0.1968^2}{\frac{0.0344}{14} + \frac{0.00013}{14}}
$$

$$
df \approx \frac{0.0387}{0.00246 + 0.0000093} \approx \frac{0.0387}{0.00247} \approx 15.67
$$

Rounding down, $df \approx 15$.

##### Step 4: Critical Value and Conclusion
For a two-tailed test with $\alpha = 0.05$ and $df = 15$, the critical $t$-value from the $t$-table is $\pm 2.131$.

Since $t = -2.41$ is less than $-2.131$, we reject $H_0$.

##### Conclusion
There is sufficient evidence to conclude a significant difference in the mean number of uncontaminated eggplants between the two disinfectants.
