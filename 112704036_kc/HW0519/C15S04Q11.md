__________
a.

$H_0: Monthly breakdown rate are same ; H_a:Monthly breakdown rate are different $
set $\alpha$ =0.05

we calculate A-B for each month, and rank the order: 6,3.5,3.5,7,5,x,1.5,1.5,8

$T^+ = 3.5+1.5+1.5 = 6.5 ; T^- = 6+3.5+7+5+8 = 29.5$ , T=6.5

Test Stastice: $T_{(9-1,0.05)}=4$ 
Rejection Region: T<4

We do not reject $H_0$;
_______
b.

Each month do not has relation about breakdown in general.
