a.

$T_A=242 T_B=164 T_C=321$

$\bar{X_A}=60.4 \bar{X_B}=54.66$ n=12

$F_{2,9,0.05}=4.26$ < $F^* = 5.704$
because p-value=0.0251<0.05 →　reject $H_0$


----
b.

99% CI : $\bar{X_A} - \bar{X_B} ± t_{9,0.01/2}*\sqrt{MSE(1/4+1/3)}=5.94±2.674 * \sqrt{14.941 * 7/12} $

=(-3.7618 , 15.4278)

----

c.

99%CI : $\bar{X_A}±t_{9,0.01/2} * \sqrt{\frac{MSE}{4}}=60.5±2.685\sqrt{\frac{14.941}{4}} $=(54.2187,66.7813) 

----
d.

Yes, because most of the data are in the 99%CI, which means 99% of the assembly workers can finish in the mean assemble time.
