a.

$\sum x_i=264.9 \sum y_i=272 $
$\sum x_i^2=14935.37 \sum y_i^2=14966.2 $

$\sum x_i y_i=14922.41 $
$\bar{x}=26.49 \bar{y}=27.2 $

$S_{xx}=14935.37-10* 26.49^2 =7918.169$

$S_{yy}=14966.2-10* 27.2^2 =7567.8$

$S_{xy}=14922.41-10* 26.49*27.2=7717.13$

$b=\frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}}=0.9558$

$a=27.2-0.9558* 26.49=1.8809$

→ y=1.8809+0.9558x

b.

yes, because the slope of the least squares regression line is 0.9558, which is very close to 1 and has positive relationship → **appear to be reasonable**.
