_____
a.

The random error is assumed to follow a normal distribution with mean zero and constant variance $\sigma^2$ , which is independent of the explanatory variable 𝑥.

______
b.

best estimation for $\sigma^2$ is MSE

$\sigma^2$ ≒　MSE = 58.05

________
c.

Although the normal probability plot shows some tail irregularities and the residual plot points to a possible outlier, there are no serious concerns with the regression assumptions. The model still fits the data fairly well.
