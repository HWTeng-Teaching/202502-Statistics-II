_______
a.

body temperature as x and heart rate as y, relate x to y

$r = 0.1741$



________
b.

1. $H_0: \rho = 0$  ; $H_a: \rho â‰  0$  
2. set $\alpha = 0.05$  
3. $t_{STAT} = r \times \sqrt{\frac{n-2}{1-r^2}} \sim t_{n-2}$ , $t_{10,0.025} = 2.228$
4. $t^* = 0.1741 \times \sqrt{\frac{10}{1-0.1741^2}} = 0.5591$
5. rejection region: t>2.228
6. not reject $H_0$

there is no sufficient evidence to indicate that there is a correlation between these two variables
