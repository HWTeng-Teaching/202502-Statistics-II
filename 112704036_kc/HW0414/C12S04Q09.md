_____________
a.

beacuse $r^2 = 0.027$ that is very small, we can assume that it has waek relationship between prices and size.

______________
b.

for the normal probability plot, these points are following the regression line.
Hence, we can see it doesn't violate the normality assumption.

for the versus fits, it shows a weak relationship, so we can assume equal variance assumption seems violated.


____________
c.

There is no clear relation between price and size.
Therefore, the assumption of linearity is violated.
