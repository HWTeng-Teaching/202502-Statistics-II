1. $H_0: p_1=p_2=p_3=\frac{1}{3}$ ; $H_a: at least one of the p_i is different$
2. set $\alpha=0.05$
3. $E_i = n* p_i = 200* \frac{1}{3} = 66.667$
4. $X^2 = \frac{{(83-66.667)}^2}{66.667} + \frac{{(61-66.667)}^2}{66.667} + \frac{{(56-66.667)}^2}{66.667} = 6.190$
5. $X_{2,0.05}^2 = 5.991 < 61.90$ rejection region: X>5.991
6. Reject $H_0$ , there is a difference in perference for the three entrances.
