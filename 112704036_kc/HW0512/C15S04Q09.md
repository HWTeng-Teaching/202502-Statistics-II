$T^+ = 1.5 + 7 + 4 + 5.5 + 3 + 5.5 = 26.5$  
  
$T^- = 1.5$  
  
1. $H_0 : p=0.5 ; H_a : p â‰  0.5$  
   
2. $\alpha = 0.1$  
    
3. test statistic: $T = min(T^+, T^-) , n=7$  
  
4. realized statistic: $T = min(T^+, T^-) = min(26.5,1.5) = 1.5$  
  
5. $\text{Rejection region: } \\{T | T <= 4 \\}$    
  
6. Because $T=1.5 < 4$, reject $H_0$ , which means that there is significant difference between the two populations.

The result of Exercise 4 is not to reject $H_0$. The results of the two tests are different because they are based on different assumptions and information.

The sign test only considers the direction (sign) of the differences and ignores their magnitude or ranking. In contrast, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test takes into account both the sign and the rank of the differences, thereby utilizing more information from the data and providing greater sensitivity to detect true differences.

Therefore, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test is generally more powerful than the sign test. In practice, when the sign test fails to reject $H_0$, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test can be used as a follow-up test to further assess the hypothesis.
