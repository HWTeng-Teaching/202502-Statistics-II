$S_1^2 = S_2^2$   $df_1 = 3 , df_2 = 2$
if Rule of Tumb avaliable, use the F-test

$F_{3,2} = \frac{S_1^2}{S_2^2}$
significance level = P($F_{3,2,\alpha/2}$ > 3)

---

for $\alpha = 0.01$
$F_{3,2,0.01} = 99.17$

for $\alpha = 0.05$
$F_{3,2,0.05} = 19.16$


for $\alpha = 0.1$
$F_{3,2,0.1} = 9.16$

bacause the rule of thumb is
