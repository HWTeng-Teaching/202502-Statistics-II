### Question 10
#### Part (a)
- Null Hypothesis ($H_0$):  $\mu_A = \mu_B = \mu_C$  
- Alternative Hypothesis ($H_a$):  $\exists \mu_i \neq \mu_j, i \neq j$  

From the given ANOVA table, we can see that the p-value is 0.0251, which is smaller than $\alpha = 0.05$. Thus we reject the null hypothesis.
Therefore, we can conclude that there is sufficient evidence to conclude that at least one of the training programs (A, B, or C) results in a significantly different mean assembly time compared to the others.

#### Part (b)
Formula:

$$
CI = (\bar{x_A} - \bar{x_B}) \pm t_{\alpha/2, df} \cdot \sqrt{MSE \left( \frac{1}{n_A} + \frac{1}{n_B} \right)}
$$  


Substituing the given values: 

$$
\bar{x}_A = 60.5, \quad \bar{x}_B = 54.667
$$  

$$
n_A = 4, \quad n_B = 3
$$  

$$
MSE = 14.941, \quad t_{0.005, 9} \approx 3.250
$$  

$$
CI = (\bar{x_A} - \bar{x_B}) \pm t_{\alpha/2, df} \cdot \sqrt{MSE \left( \frac{1}{n_A} + \frac{1}{n_B} \right)} = 5.833 \pm 9.59 = (-3.757,\ 15.423)
$$  

We are 99% confident that the true difference in mean assembly times between A and B lies between -3.757 and 15.423 minutes.
Since the interval includes 0, the difference is not statistically significant at the 99% confidence level.

#### Part (c)
Formula:

$$
CI = \bar{x_A} \pm t_{\alpha/2, df} \cdot \frac{s_A}{\sqrt{n_A}}
$$

Values:

$$
\bar{x}_A = 60.5,\quad s_A = \sqrt{9.667} \approx 3.109
$$

$$
n_A = 4,\quad df = n_A - 1 = 3
$$

$$
t_{0.005, 3} \approx 5.841\ 
$$

Calculation:

$$
CI = \bar{x_A} \pm t_{\alpha/2, df} \cdot \frac{s_A}{\sqrt{n_A}} = 60.5 \pm 9.08 = (51.42,\ 69.58)
$$

We are 99% confident that the true mean assembly time for program A lies between 51.42 and 69.58 minutes.

#### Part (d)
Evaluation of the Data:

1. Sample Size Considerations:
   - The sample sizes are small (Group A: n=4, Group B: n=3, Group C: n=5)
   - While small samples make normality testing less reliable, ANOVA is generally robust to minor deviations from normality with such sample sizes

2. Variance Analysis:
   - The variance ratios show moderate differences (maximum variance 21.7 vs minimum 9.333)
   - The ratio of largest to smallest variance (2.33:1) is well below the 4:1 rule of thumb, suggesting acceptable homogeneity

3. Distribution Characteristics:
   - The reported data points show no extreme outliers
   - The ranges are reasonable (A: 57-64, B: 52-58, C: 58-71)
   - No obvious skewness is apparent in the group distributions

Conclusion:
The data appears to approximately satisfy the normality assumption for ANOVA because:
- The variance differences are within acceptable limits
- There are no indications of severe non-normality in the reported values
- While formal tests would be preferable with such small samples, the available data doesn't show obvious violations

Final Determination:
Based on the available information, the normality assumption appears reasonably met for conducting ANOVA in this case. However, results should be interpreted with appropriate caution given the small sample sizes.
