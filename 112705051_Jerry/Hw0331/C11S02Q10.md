### Question 10
#### Part (a)
From the given ANOVA table, we can see that the p-value is 0.0251, which is smaller than $\alpha = 0.05$.
Therefore, we can conclude that there is sufficient evidence to conclude that at least one of the training programs (A, B, or C) results in a significantly different mean assembly time compared to the others.
