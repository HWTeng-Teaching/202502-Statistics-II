### Question 16
#### Given Data:
- Sample Means:
  - $\bar{X_1} = 262 $
  - $\bar{x_2} = 234.8$  
  - $\bar{x_3} = 251.6$  
  - $\bar{x_4} = 268.6$   
- MSE = 41.25  
- df = 16 
- $n_i = 16$
- k = 4

The standard error for Tukey's method is:  

$$
SE = \sqrt{\frac{MSE}{n_i}} = \sqrt{\frac{41.25}{5}} = \sqrt{8.25} \approx 2.872
$$

For $\alpha = 0.01, k = 4, df =16$ 
- From statistical tables or software, $q_{0.01, 4, 16} \approx 5.05$.  

The critical value for Tukey's test is:  

$$
\text{Tukey's HSD} = q_{\alpha, k, df} \times SE = 5.05 \times 2.872 \approx 14.50
$$

*(HSD = Honestly Significant Difference)*  

Compare all pairs of sample means and check if their difference exceeds HSD (\(14.50\)):  

| Pair               | Difference  | Significant? |  
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|  
| $\bar{x_1} - \bar{x_2}$ | 262.2 - 234.8 = 27.4                  | Yes                         |  
| $\bar{x_1} - \bar{x_3}$ | 262.2 - 251.6 = 10.6                  | No                               |  
| $\bar{x_1} - \bar{x_4}$ | 268.6 - 262.2 = 6.4                   | No                               |  
| $\bar{x_2} - \bar{x_3}$ | 251.6 - 234.8 = 16.8                  | Yes                          |  
| $\bar{x_2} - \bar{x_4}$ | 268.6 - 234.8 = 33.8                  | Yes                          |  
| $\bar{x_3} - \bar{x_4}$ | 268.6 - 251.6 = 17.0                  | Yes                          |  
 
At the $\alpha = 0.01$ level:  
- **Significant differences exist between:**  
  - State 1 and State 2 (262.2 vs. 234.8)  
  - State 2 and State 3 (234.8 vs. 251.6)  
  - State 2 and State 4 (234.8 vs. 268.6)  
  - State 3 and State 4 (251.6 vs. 268.6)  
- **No significant difference between:**  
  - State 1 and State 3 (262.2 vs. 251.6)  
  - State 1 and State 4 (262.2 vs. 268.6)  

State 2 (234.8) has significantly lower lumber costs compared to all other states. States 3 and 4, as well as States 1 and 3, are not statistically distinguishable from each other at the 1% significance level.    
At $\alpha = 0.01$, the average lumber cost of State 2 (234.8) is significantly lower than the costs of States 1, 3, and 4. No other pairs show significant differences.
