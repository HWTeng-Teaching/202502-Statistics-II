### Question 14
The proportion of defective items among 100 items recorded over 25 days is **unlikely to be normal**.

Reason: Proportions are bounded between 0 and 1, and their distribution is often skewed, especially if the true proportion is close to 0 or 1. For small sample sizes (like 100 items), the distribution may not approximate normality unless the proportion is near 0.5 and the sample size is large enough for the Central Limit Theorem to apply. Here, normality is questionable.
