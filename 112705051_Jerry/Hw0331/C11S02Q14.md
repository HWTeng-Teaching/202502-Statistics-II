### Question 14
#### Part (a)

| **Type**               | **Prices ($)** | **Count (n)** | **Sum (T)** | **Mean** | **Sum of Squares** |
|------------------------|----------------|---------------|-------------|----------|--------------------|
| Light Tuna in Water    | 0.99, 1.92, 1.23, 0.85, 0.65, 0.69, 0.60 | 7 | 6.93 | 0.99 | 7.91 |
| White Tuna in Water    | 0.53, 1.41, 1.12, 0.63, 0.67, 0.60, 0.66 | 7 | 5.62 | 0.80 | 4.88 |
| White Tuna in Oil      | 1.49, 1.29, 1.27, 1.35, 1.29, 1.00, 1.27, 1.28 | 8 | 10.24 | 1.28 | 13.19 |
| Light Tuna in Oil      | 1.27, 1.22, 1.19, 1.22, 1.23 | 5 | 6.13 | 1.23 | 7.53 |
| Total              | | N = 27 | T = 28.92 | Ȳ = 1.07 | ∑x² = 33.51 |

- Correction Factor (CM):
   $$CM = \frac{(T)^2}{N} = \frac{(28.92)^2}{27} = \frac{836.37}{27} = 30.98$$

- Total Sum of Squares (TSS):
   $$TSS = \sum x^2 - CM = 33.51 - 30.98 = 2.53$$

- Treatment Sum of Squares (SST):
   $$SST = \sum \frac{T_i^2}{n_i} - CM = \left(\frac{6.93^2}{7} + \frac{5.62^2}{7} + \frac{10.24^2}{8} + \frac{6.13^2}{5}\right) - 30.98 =32.00−30.98=1.02$$

- Error Sum of Squares (SSE):
   $$SSE = TSS - SST = 2.53 - 1.02 = 1.51$$

- Degrees of Freedom:
   - Between treatments (dfB): k - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3
   - Within treatments (dfW): N - k = 27 - 4 = 23

- Mean Squares:
   - MST = SST / dfB = 1.02 / 3 = 0.34
   - MSE = SSE / dfW = 1.51 / 23 = 0.07

- F-statistic:
   $$F = \frac{MST}{MSE} = \frac{0.34}{0.07} = 4.86$$

| Source of Variation | SS  | df | MS  | F-value |
|-------------------------|---------|--------|---------|-------------|
| Between Treatments      | 1.02    | 3      | 0.34    | 4.86        |
| Within Treatments       | 1.51    | 23     | 0.07    |             |
| Total              | 2.53| 26 |         |             |

#### Part (b)
- Null Hypothesis ($H_0$):  $\mu_A = \mu_B = \mu_C$  
- Alternative Hypothesis ($H_a$):  $\exists \mu_i \neq \mu_j, i \neq j$ 

Test Results from ANOVA Table (Part a):
- F-value = 4.86
- Degrees of Freedom: Numerator (df₁) = 3, Denominator (df₂) = 23

At α = 0.05 level:
   - Since 4.86 > 3.03, we **reject H₀**
   - There is **significant evidence** of price differences among tuna types
The packaging type (light/white, water/oil) appears to significantly affect tuna prices nationally. This finding holds at 5% of significance levels.

#### Part (c)
Data Summary:
| Tuna Type          | n  | Mean ($) | Variance (s²) |
|--------------------|----|----------|--------------|
| Light Tuna Water   | 7  | 0.99     | 0.18         |
| Light Tuna Oil     | 5  | 1.23     | 0.0007       |

Compute the pooled variance:

$$
s_p^2 = \frac{(n_1-1)s_1^2 + (n_2-1)s_2^2}{n_1+n_2-2} = \frac{6(0.18) + 4(0.0007)}{10} = 0.108 
$$

Standard error:

$$
SE = \sqrt{s_p^2 \left( \frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2} \right)} = \sqrt{0.108 \left( \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{5} \right)} = 0.19
$$

For 95% CI with df = n₁+n₂-2 = 10:

$$
t_{0.025,10} = 2.228 
$$

$$
ME = t \times SE = 2.228 \times 0.19 = 0.42 
$$

$$
CI = (\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2) \pm ME = -0.24 \pm 0.42 = (-0.66, 0.18) 
$$

We are 95% confident that the true mean price difference between light tuna in water and oil lies between -$0.66 and $0.18. Since the interval includes zero, there is no statistically significant difference in prices at the 5% significance level.

#### Part (d)

| Tuna Type          | n  | Mean ($) | Variance (s²) |
|--------------------|----|----------|--------------|
| White Tuna Water   | 7  | 0.80     | 0.12         |
| White Tuna Oil     | 8  | 1.28     | 0.01         |

Using the same formula and method from part (C), we get the
95% CI: -0.48 ± 0.24 = (-0.72, -0.24) 

We are 95% confident white tuna in water is $0.24 to $0.72 cheaper than oil-packed. The entirely negative interval indicates a statistically significant price difference (p<0.05).

### Part (e) 

1. **Water-packed Comparison:**
   - Light vs. White tuna in water
   - Would show if color affects pricing within water-packed products

2. **Oil-packed Comparison:**
   - Light vs. White tuna in oil
   - Tests whether color affects pricing in oil-packed varieties

3. **Packaging Medium Comparison:**
   - Water vs. oil packaging for same color tuna
   - Could confirm findings from parts (c) and (d) more broadly

4. **Premium Product Comparison:**
   - White tuna in oil (highest mean) vs. light tuna in water (lowest mean)
   - Would quantify the maximum price difference in the product line

All intervals should use 95% confidence for consistency with previous analyses. The researcher might prioritize comparisons that test specific hypotheses about consumer willingness to pay for different product attributes.
