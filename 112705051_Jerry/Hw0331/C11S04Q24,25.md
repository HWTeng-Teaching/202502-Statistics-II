### Problem 24

#### Part (a)
- **Blocks**: The 8 items (e.g., Salad mix, Hillshire Farm® Beef Smoked Sausage, etc.).  
  *Reason*: Items are the experimental units grouped to control for variability in product types.  
- **Treatments**: The 4 grocery stores (Vons, Ralphs, Stater Bros, WinCo).  
  *Reason*: Stores are the factors being compared for their effect on prices.  

#### Part (b)
Hypotheses:  
- $H_0$: Mean prices are equal across all stores 
- $H_a$: At least one store’s mean price differs.  

From the table:  
- Store SS = 13.192
- MS = 4.3974
- F = 26.52
- p = 0.000.  

Since p < 0.05\, **we reject the null hypotheses**. There is significant evidence that at least one store’s mean price differs from others.  

#### Part (c)

- Item SS = 40.995
- MS = 5.8564
- F = 35.32
- p = 0.000.  

**Conclusion**:  
- **Significant Block Differences**: extremely small p-value indicates prices vary significantly by item.  
- **Blocking Was Effective**: The high F-value for items suggests blocking reduced error variance, improving the sensitivity of store comparisons.  

### Problem 25
#### Part (a)
- Parameters:  
  - k = 4 
  - $df_{error} = 21$  
- $q_{0.05}(4,21) \approx 3.94$

#### Part (b) 

$$
\omega = q_{0.05}(4, 21) \times \sqrt{\frac{MSE}{b}} = 3.94 \times \sqrt{\frac{0.1658}{8}} = 3.94 \times 0.144 \approx 0.567
$$  

#### Part (c)  
Store Means:  
| Store       | Mean Price |  
|-------------|------------|  
| WinCo       | 2.68125    |  
| Stater Bros | 3.85250    |  
| Vons        | 4.13500    |  
| Ralphs      | 4.34000    |  

Compare Differences to $\omega = 0.567$:  
| Pair                     | Difference | Significant? |  
|--------------------------|------------|--------------|  
| WinCo vs. Ralphs         | 1.65875    | **Yes**      |  
| WinCo vs. Vons           | 1.45375    | **Yes**      |  
| WinCo vs. Stater Bros    | 1.17125    | **Yes**      |  
| Stater Bros vs. Ralphs   | 0.48750    | No           |  
| Stater Bros vs. Vons     | 0.28250    | No           |  
| Vons vs. Ralphs          | 0.20500    | No           |  

**Conclusion**:  
- **WinCo** has significantly lower prices than all other stores.  
- No significant differences between Ralphs, Vons, and Stater Bros.
