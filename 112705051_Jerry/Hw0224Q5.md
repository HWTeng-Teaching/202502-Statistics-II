### Question 35

## **(a) Hypothesis Test at 5% Significance Level**  
 
- Null hypothesis:  
  $\ H_0: \mu = 22.0$  
- Alternative hypothesis (one-tailed test):  
  $\ H_a: \mu > 22.0 $  
  This suggests a right-tailed test.

The test statistic t for a single-sample t-test after substituing the value is:  

$$
t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{s / \sqrt{n}} = \frac{31.0 - 22.0}{6.2 / \sqrt{17}} = \frac{9.0}{1.503} \approx 5.99
$$  

Degrees of freedom df = n - 1 = 17 - 1 = 16 

From the t-table, for a one-tailed test at **$\alpha = 0.05$** with **df = 16**:  

$$
t_{0.05,16} \approx 1.746 < 5.99 = t
$$  

From the results we got, we **reject** the null hypothesis.

### **Conclusion:**  
At the **5% significance level**, there is **sufficient evidence** to conclude that **injected rats drink more water** than non-injected rats.

---

## **(b) 90% Confidence Interval for $\mu$**  

First, find the critical value from the **t-table** for **90% confidence** and **df = 16**:  

$$
t_{0.05,16} \approx 1.746
$$  

Compute the margin of error (ME):  

$$
ME = 1.746 \times 1.503 = 2.62
$$  

Thus, the **90% confidence interval** is:  

$$
CI = \bar{x} \pm t_{\alpha/2, df} \times SE = 31.0 \pm ME = 31.0 \pm 2.62 = (31.0 - 2.62, 31.0 + 2.62) = (28.38, 33.62)
$$  

### **Final Answer:**  
We are **90% confident** that the true mean water intake for injected rats is **between 28.38 cm³ and 33.62 cm³**.
