### Question 30
### **(a) Interpretation of the Output**  

#### **Descriptive Statistics:**  
- Sample size: $n = 27$  
- Sample mean: $\bar{x} = 1.0522$  
- Sample standard deviation: $s = 0.1657$  
- Standard error of the mean (SE Mean):  
  $SE = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{0.1657}{\sqrt{27}} = 0.0319$  
- 95% confidence interval (CI) for $\mu$= (0.9867, 1.1178)  

#### **Hypothesis Test:**  
- Null hypothesis $\ H_0: \mu = 1 $  
- Alternative hypothesis $\ H_a: \mu \neq 1 $  
- Test statistic (t-value): 1.64
- p-value: 0.113 

#### **Interpretation:**  
Since the **p-value (0.113) > significance level (0.05)**, we **fail to reject** the null hypothesis.  
This suggests that there is **not enough evidence** to conclude that the true mean weight differs from 1 pound.

### **(b) Verification of the t-value and Confidence Limits**  

#### **Step 1: Compute the t-value**  
The formula for the t-statistic is:  

$$
t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{SE}
$$  

Substituting the given values:  

$$
t = \frac{1.0522 - 1}{0.0319} = \frac{0.0522}{0.0319} \approx 1.64
$$  

Thus, the calculated **t-value is verified**.  

#### **Step 2: Compute the 95% Confidence Interval**  
The confidence interval is given by:  



For $df = n - 1 = 26$, the critical value from the **t-table** for a **95% confidence level** is:  

$$
t_{0.025,26} \approx 2.056
$$  

Now, calculate the margin of error (ME):  

$$
ME = t_{\alpha/2, df} \times SE = 2.056 \times 0.0319 = 0.0656
$$  

Thus, the confidence interval is:  

$$
CI = \bar{x} \pm ME = (1.0522 - 0.0656, 1.0522 + 0.0656) = (0.9866, 1.1178)
$$    

After rounding, this matches the **reported confidence interval (0.9867, 1.1178)**, so our calculations are **correct**.

---

### **Conclusion**  
Both the t-value and the confidence interval calculations have been successfully verified.  
The results suggest that the mean package weight **does not significantly differ** from 1 pound at the **5% significance level**.
