## Question 20

First, we set up the hypothesis:
- Null Hypothesis $\ H_0: \mu_d = 0 \$
- Alternative Hypothesis $\ H_a: \mu_d > 0 \$
 ($\mu_d$ is the mean of the paired differences between "With Imagery" and "Without Imagery.")

Set $d_i$ as follows:

$$
d_i = X_{\text{with imagery}} - X_{\text{without imagery}}
$$

And we acquire the following table, 
| Students | With Imagery | Without Imagery | $d_i$ |
|------|------------------|-------------------|------------|
| 1    | 20               | 5                 | 15         |
| 2    | 24               | 9                 | 15         |
| ...  | ...              | ...               | ...        |
| 20   | 23               | 13                | 10         |
(Several columns are omitted)
Where the mean of $d_i$ is $\bar{d} = \frac{\sum d_i}{n} = \frac{191}{20} = 9.55$

The standard deviation $s_d$ is calculated: 
$s_d = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (d_i - \bar{d})^2}{n - 1}} = 4.99$

Therefore, we can get the standard error (SE):
$SE = \frac{s_d}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{4.99}{4.47} = 1.12$

Calculate the t-value:

$$
t = \frac{\bar{d} - 0}{SE} = \frac{9.55}{1.12} = 8.53
$$

Verifying:
df = n - 1 = 20 - 1 = 19, with $\alpha=0.05$

After consulting the t-table, we get $t_{0.05, 19} = 1.729$

Since the calculated t=8.53 is significantly bigger than $t_{0.05, 19} = 1.729$, we **reject the null hypothesis**.
Therefore, we extrapolate that when using imagery, the average recall score is higher.
