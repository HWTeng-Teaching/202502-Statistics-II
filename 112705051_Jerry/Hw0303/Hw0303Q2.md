### Question (a) 
  
1° 
Stating the hypothesis:
- Null hypothesis: $H_0: \mu_{\text{below}} = \mu_{\text{above}}$  $i.e.$ $\mu_{\text{below}} - \mu_{\text{above}} = 0$
- Alternative hypothesis: $H_A: \mu_{\text{below}} < \mu_{\text{above}}$  $i.e.$ $\mu_{\text{below}} - \mu_{\text{above}} < 0$

This suggests a **one-tailed t-test**.

We acquired the following data from the question:
- Sample mean above town = $\bar{x}_{\text{above}} = \bar{x}_A = 5.00$
- Sample mean below town = $\bar{x}_{\text{below}} = \bar{x}_B = 4.86$
- Sample standard deviation above town = $s_{\text{above}} = s_A = 0.173$
- Sample standard deviation below town = $s_{\text{below}} = s_B = 0.114$
- Sample sizes $n_{\text{above}} = n_A = 5$, $n_{\text{below}} = n_B = 5$

The test statistic is calculated as

$$
t = \frac{\bar{x}_A - \bar{x}_B}
{\sqrt{\frac{s_A^2}{n_A} + \frac{s_B^2}{n_B}}}
$$

Substituting values:

$$
t = \frac{\bar{x}_A - \bar{x}_B}
{\sqrt{\frac{s_A^2}{n_A} + \frac{s_B^2}{n_B}}} = \frac{5.00 - 4.86}{\sqrt{\frac{0.173^2}{5} + \frac{0.114^2}{5}}} = 1.606
$$

From the thumb rule, we know that when

$$
\frac{Bigger \ S^2}{Smaller \ S^2} > 3
$$

(S represents the sample variance)
We can use the pooled estimator. 

Since 

$$
\frac{0.173^2}{0.114^2} < 3
$$

, we use pooled estimator. 
$df=n_1+n_2-2=5+5-2=8$, and given $\alpha = 0.05$ (single-tailed test), we find that
the critical value for $\ t_{0.05,8}$ is 1.860, which is bigger than the calculated t value.

Therefore, we **cannot reject** the null hypothesis, which means that the oxygen content below the town may not be significantly lower.

### Question (b)
From question (a), we get the below information:
- Sample mean above town = $\bar{x}_A = 5.00$
- Sample mean below town = $\bar{x}_B = 4.86$
- Sample standard deviation above town = $s_A = 0.173$
- Sample standard deviation below town = $s_B = 0.114$
- Sample sizes = $n_A = 5$, $n_B = 5$

When assuming two sets of data have the same variance, the pooled estimator for variance will be:

$$
s_p^2 = \frac{(n_1 - 1)s_1^2 + (n_2 - 1)s_2^2}{n_1 + n_2 - 2}
$$

Substituing the given values in:

$$
s_p^2 = \frac{(n_1 - 1)s_1^2 + (n_2 - 1)s_2^2}{n_1 + n_2 - 2} = \frac{(5-1)(0.1581)^2 + (5-1)(0.1140)^2}{5+5-2} = 0.019
$$

Calculate the Standard Error (SE):

$$
SE = s_p \sqrt{\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2}} = 0.1378 \times \sqrt{\frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{5}} = 0.1378 \times 0.6325 = 0.0872
$$

The formula for calculating a 95% confidence interval is as followed:
```math
\text{C.I.} = (\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2) \pm t_{\alpha/2, df} \times SE
```
```math
t_{\alpha/2, 8} = t_{0.025, 8} = 2.306
```

After acquiring the t necessary for the formula,
```math
\text{CI} = 0.14 \pm (2.306 \times 0.0872) = = (-0.0613, 0.3413)
```

At a 95% confidence level, the estimated range for the difference in mean dissolved oxygen content between upstream and downstream is (-0.061, 0.341).
Since this confidence interval includes 0, it indicates that we cannot confirm a significant difference in dissolved oxygen content between upstream and downstream.
