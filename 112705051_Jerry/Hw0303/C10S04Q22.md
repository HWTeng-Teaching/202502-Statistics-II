## Question 20

#### Question (a): 

We first set up the hypothesis:
- Null Hypothesis $\ H_0: \mu_d = 0 \$
- Alternative Hypothesis $\ H_a: \mu_d \neq 0 \$

where $d = \text{Batter A} - \text{Batter B}$.

We calculate the difference for each location and produce a table:

| Location | Batter A | Batter B | Difference d=A-B |
|----------|---------|---------|----------------|
| 1        | 0.135   | 0.129   | 0.006          |
| 2        | 0.102   | 0.120   | -0.018         |
| 3        | 0.098   | 0.112   | -0.014         |
| 4        | 0.141   | 0.152   | -0.011         |
| 5        | 0.131   | 0.135   | -0.004         |
| 6        | 0.144   | 0.163   | -0.019         |

The sample mean
$\bar{d} = \frac{\sum d_i}{n} = \frac{0.006 + (-0.018) + (-0.014) + (-0.011) + (-0.004) + (-0.019)}{6} = -0.010$


The sample standard deviation 
$s_d = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (d_i - \bar{d})^2}{n-1}} = 0.00952$

The t-statistic for a paired t-test is:

$$
t = \frac{\bar{d} - 0}{s_d / \sqrt{n}}
$$

where:
- $\bar{d}\$ = mean difference = -0.01
- $s_d$ = standard deviation = 0.00952

Substituing the values:

$$
t = \frac{-0.010}{0.00952 / \sqrt{6}} = -2.5706
$$

With df = n-1 = 5 at the chosen significance level (e.g., $\alpha = 0.05$), the critical t-value from the t-table is **±2.571**

Since |t| = 2.5706 is slightly less than 2.571, we **fail to reject** $H_0$.
Therefore, there is **not sufficient evidence** to conclude that the two cake mixes produce significantly different densities.


#### Question (b): 
A 95% confidence interval for the mean difference is given by:

$$
C.I. = \bar{d} \pm t_{\alpha/2, df} \times \frac{s_d}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

Substituing the values:

$$
C.I. = -0.010 \pm 2.571 \times \frac{0.00952}{\sqrt{6}} = (-0.020, 0.000)
$$

Since **0 is included** in the confidence interval, we **do not have sufficient evidence** to claim a significant difference in the average densities of the two cake mixes.
Thus, we **do not have enough evidence** to conclude that the two cake mixes produce different densities.
