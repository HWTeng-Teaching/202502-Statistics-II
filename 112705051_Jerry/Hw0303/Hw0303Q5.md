## Question 11:

We first set up the hypothesis:
- Null Hypothesis $\ H_0: \mu_d = 0 \$
- Alternative Hypothesis $\ H_a: \mu_d \neq 0 \$

where $d = \text{Stimulus 1} - \text{Stimulus 2} = S1 - S2$.


Calculate the difference for each individual:

| Person | Stimulus 1 | Stimulus 2 | Difference d=S1-S2 |
|--------|------------|------------|------------|
| 1      | 1          | 4          | -3         |
| 2      | 3          | 2          | 1          |
| 3      | 2          | 3          | -1         |
| 4      | 1          | 3          | -2         |
| 5      | 2          | 2          | 0          |
| 6      | 1          | 2          | -1         |
| 7      | 3          | 3          | 0          |
| 8      | 2          | 3          | -1         |

The sample mean difference $\bar{d} = \frac{\sum d_i}{n} = \frac{-7}{8} = -0.875$
The sample standard deviation of differences $s_d = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (d_i - \bar{d})^2}{n-1}} = 1.246$

The t-statistic for a paired t-test is:

$$
t = \frac{\bar{d} - 0}{s_d / \sqrt{n}}
$$

SUbstituing the values:

$$
t = \frac{\bar{d} - 0}{s_d / \sqrt{n}} = \frac{-0.875}{1.246 / \sqrt{8}} = -1.98
$$

With df = n-1 = 7 at the chosen significance level (e.g., $\alpha = 0.05$), the critical t-value from the t-table is $t_{0.025, 8} = Â±2.365$

Since |t| = 1.98  is less than 2.365, we **fail to reject the null hypothesis** at $\alpha = 0.05$.
There is **not sufficient evidence** to conclude that the two stimuli produce significantly different reaction times.
