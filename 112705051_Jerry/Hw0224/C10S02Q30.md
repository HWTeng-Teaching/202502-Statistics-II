### Question 30
### **(a) Hypothesis Test**  

#### **Given Data:**
- Sample mean: $\bar{x} = 20.3$  
- Hypothesized mean: $\mu_0 = 25$  
- Sample standard deviation: $s = 5.0$  
- Sample size: $n = 21$  
- Significance level: $\alpha = 0.05$
- Hypotheses:
  - Null Hypothesis $\ H_0 : \mu = 25$
  - Alternative Hypothesis $\ H_a : \mu < 25$

The test statistic t is calculated:  

$$
t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{s / \sqrt{n}} = \frac{20.3 - 25}{5.0 / \sqrt{21}} = \frac{-4.7}{1.091} \approx -4.31
$$  

Using a t-table with $df = n - 1 = 20$ at $\alpha = 0.05$ (one-tailed test),  

$$
t_{0.05,20} \approx -1.725 > -4.31 = t
$$  

Based on the result, we **reject** the null hypothesis.  

#### Conclusion: 
There is sufficient evidence at the 5% significance level to conclude that the true pretreatment mean is less than 25.

### **(b) 95% Confidence Interval**  

#### **Given Data:**
- $\bar{x} = 26.6, \quad s = 7.4, \quad n = 21$  

For $df = 20$ at $\alpha = 0.05$ (two-tailed test),  

$$
t_{0.025,20} \approx 2.086
$$  

With the information, the margin of error (ME) is calculated:  

$$
ME = t_{\alpha/2, df} \times \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} = 2.086 \times \frac{7.4}{\sqrt{21}} = 2.086 \times 1.614 \approx 3.37
$$  

Therefore, the confidencence interval will be:

$$
(\bar{x} - ME, \bar{x} + ME) = (26.6 - 3.37, 26.6 + 3.37) = (23.23, 29.97)
$$    

#### Conclusion: 
We are 95% confident that the true posttreatment mean lies within the interval (23.23, 29.97).

### **(c) Observing Differences**  

By analyzing the means:  
- Pretreatment: $20.3$  
- Posttreatment: $26.6$  
- Follow-up: $27.7$  

The means increase from pretreatment to posttreatment and further slightly increase at follow-up. Since the standard deviations are relatively moderate, this suggests that the treatment **likely has a positive effect** on self-esteem.  

Remark: Without being introduced to a formal test, we cannot determine if these differences are statistically significant.
