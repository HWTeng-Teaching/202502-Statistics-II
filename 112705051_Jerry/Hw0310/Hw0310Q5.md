## Question 22

#### Question (a)

We first set up the hypothesis:
- Null Hypothesis $\ H_0: \sigma_1^2 = \sigma_2^2\$ 
- Alternative Hypothesis $\ H_a: \sigma_1^2 \neq \sigma_2^2\$

Based on the vignette, we have the following information:
- $\bar{x}_{\text{stock one}} = \bar{x}_1 = 40.33$
- $\bar{x}_{\text{stock two}} = \bar{x}_2 = 42.54$
- $s^2_{\text{stock one}} = s^2_1 = 1.54$
- $s^2_{\text{stock two}} = s^2_2 = 2.96$

Compute the f-value with the following formula:

$$
F = \frac{s_1^2}{s_2^2} = \frac{1.54}{2.96} = 0.52
$$

To calculate the p-value, we need to use the formula below (we use $\alpha = 0.01$):

$$
p-value = P(F<0.52)=P(F>\frac{1}{0.52}) = P(F>1.92)
$$

Since we **cannot** calculate the precise p-value, we have to use approximation instead

The degree of freedom ($df$) for both dataset is:

$df_1 = n_1 - 1 = 15 - 1 = 14 = df_2$

However, we do not have rows or columns indicating the critical value when both degree of freedom is 14.
In order to approximate, we need to find the closest two.

The closest two is when 

$$
(df_1, df_2) = (15, 14), (12, 14)
$$

Under the circumstance of $(df_1, df_2) = (12, 14)$, we get 

$$
P(F>4.43) = 0.005 > P(F>0.52)
$$

and when  $(df_1, df_2) = (15, 14)$

$$
P(F>4.25) = 0.005 > P(F>1.92)
$$

Since

$$
P(F>1.92 | (df_1, df_2) = (12, 14)) > P(F>1.92 | (df_1, df_2) = (14, 14))
$$

and

$$
P(F>1.92 | (df_1, df_2) = (14, 14)) > P(F>1.92 | (df_1, df_2) = (15, 14))
$$

Therefore

$$
P(F>1.92 | (df_1, df_2) = (14, 14)) > 0.005 = \frac{\alpha}{2}
$$

Since the p-value do not exceed 0.005, which is the half value of the chosen $\alpha$, we **cannot reject
the null hypothesis**. Therefore, we do not have sufficient evidence to conclude that there is a significant 
difference between the variabilities of the closing prices of the two stocks.

#### Question (b)

The formula for calculating the confidence interval in f-test is:

$$
C.I. = \left( \frac{s_1^2}{s_2^2 \times F_{n_1-1,n_2-1,(\alpha/2)}}, \frac{s_1^2 \times F_{n_2-1,n_1-1,(\alpha/2)}}{s_2^2} \right)
$$

Substituing the given values in, we get:

$$
C.I. = \left( \frac{s_1^2}{s_2^2 \times F_{n_1-1,n_2-1,(\alpha/2)}}, \frac{s_1^2 \times F_{n_2-1,n_1-1,(\alpha/2)}}{s_2^2} \right)
= \left( \frac{1.54}{2.96 \times F_{14,14,0.005}}, \frac{1.54 \times F_{14,14,0.005}}{2.96} \right) 
$$

Since we cannot gather the information when $df_1 = df_2 = 14$, we use $(df_1, df_2) = (15,14)$ instead

$$
C.I. = \left( \frac{1.54}{2.96 \times F_{15,14,0.005}}, \frac{1.54 \times F_{15,14,0.005}}{2.96} \right) \approx (0.152,1.783)
$$

The 99% confidence interval for the ratio of the population variances 
is approximately (0.152, 1.783). Since this interval **includes 1**, it suggests that 
**there is no significant difference between the variances of the closing prices of the two stocks at the 99% confidence level**.
