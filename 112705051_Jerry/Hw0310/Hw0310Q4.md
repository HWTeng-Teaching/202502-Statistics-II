## Question 16

We first set up the hypothesis:
- Null Hypothesis $\ H_0: \sigma_1^2 = \sigma_2^2\$ 
- Alternative Hypothesis $\ H_a: \sigma_1^2 \neq \sigma_2^2\$

Based on the vignette, we have the following information:
- $\bar{x}_{\text{chemistry}} = \bar{x}_1 = 784$
- $\bar{x}_{\text{physics}} = \bar{x}_2 = 758$
- $s_{\text{chemistry}} = s_1 = 114$
- $s_{\text{physics}} = s_2 = 103$
- $n_{\text{chemistry}} = n_1 = 15 = n_2 = n_{\text{physics}}$

Compute the f-value with the following formula:

$$
F = \frac{s_2^2}{s_1^2} = \frac{(114)^2}{(103)^2} = 1.22
$$

To calculate the p-value, we need to use the formula below (we use $\alpha = 0.10$):

$$
p-value = P(F>1.22)
$$

Since we **cannot** calculate the precise p-value, we have to use approximation instead

The degree of freedom ($df$) for both dataset is:

$df_1 = n_1 - 1 = 15 - 1 = 14 = df_2$

However, we do not have rows or columns indicating the critical value when both degree of freedom is 14.
In order to approximate, we need to find the closest two.

The closest two is when 

$$
(df_1, df_2) = (15, 14), (12, 14)
$$

Under the circumstance of $(df_1, df_2) = (12, 14)$, we get 

$$
P(F>1.22) > 0.05 = P(F>2.53)
$$

and when  $(df_1, df_2) = (15, 14)$

$$
P(F>1.22) > 0.05 = P(F>2.01)
$$

Since

$$
P(F>1.22 | (df_1, df_2) = (12, 14)) > P(F>1.22 | (df_1, df_2) = (14, 14)) > P(F>1.22 | (df_1, df_2) = (15, 14))
$$

Therefore

$$
P(F>1.22 | (df_1, df_2) = (12, 14)) > 0.05 = \frac{\alpha}{2}
$$

Indicating that we **cannot reject the null hypothesis**. 
Encapsulating that there is **insufficient evidence to conclude that the variances of the SAT scores in chemistry and physics are significantly different**.
