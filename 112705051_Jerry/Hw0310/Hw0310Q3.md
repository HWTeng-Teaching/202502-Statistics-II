## Question 14

We first set up the hypothesis:
- Null Hypothesis $\ H_0: \sigma_1^2 = \sigma_2^2\$ 
- Alternative Hypothesis $\ H_a: \sigma_1^2 < \sigma_2^2\$

Based on the vignette, we have the following information:
- $\bar{x}_{\text{new}} = \bar{x}_1 = 246$
- $\bar{x}_{\text{old}} = \bar{x}_2 = 240$
- $s_{\text{new}} = s_1 = 15.6$
- $s_{\text{old}} = s_2 = 28.2$

Since we are comparing two different variances, we have to use the **F-test**.

Compute the f-value with the following formula:

$$
F = \frac{s_2^2}{s_1^2} = \frac{(28.2)^2}{(15.6)^2} = 3.27
$$

(**Remark to myself**: Usually we calculate the f-value with the set of the bigger variance on the numerator, but if accidently reversed, then the calculated result would be less than one, therefore suggests a bizarre estimation. Thus use $P(F<c|c<1) = P(F>\frac{1}{c})$ instead to better fit intuition.)

To calculate the p-value, we need to use the formula below **(we use $\alpha = 0.05$)**:

$$
p-value = P(F>3.27)
$$

Since we **cannot** calculate the precise p-value, we have to use approximation instead

The degree of freedom ($df$) for both dataset is:

$df_1 = n_1 - 1 = 30 - 1 = 29 = df_2$

However, we do not have rows or columns indicating the critical value when both degree of freedom is 29.
In order to approximate, we need to find the closest two.

The closest two is when 

$$
(df_1, df_2) = (24, 29), (30, 29)
$$

Under the circumstance of $(df_1, df_2) = (24, 29)$, we get 

$$
P(F>2.76) = 0.05 > P(F>3.27)
$$

Now compare when $(df_1, df_2) = (24 or 30, 29)$, we get

$$
P(F>3.27 | (df_1, df_2) = (24, 29)) > P(F>3.27 | (df_1, df_2) = (30, 29))
$$

Therefore

$$
0.05 > P(F>3.27 | (df_1, df_2) = (24, 29)) > P(F>3.27 | (df_1, df_2) = (29, 29))
$$

and

$$
P(F>3.27 | (df_1, df_2) = (29, 29)) > P(F>3.27 | (df_1, df_2) = (30, 29))
$$

Indicating that

$$
P(F>3.27 | (df_1, df_2) = (29, 29)) < 0.05 = \alpha
$$

Thus, we can conclude that the p-value is **less** than the given $\alpha$, then we can eventually say that
we can **reject the null hypothesis**. This provides sufficient evidence to conclude that the **variability in daily production of the older fabricating system is significantly greater than that of the new system**. Therefore, increased maintenance of the older system may be warranted to address its higher variability.
