## Question 14

#### Question (a)

We first set up the hypothesis:
- Null Hypothesis $\ H_0: \sigma_1^2 = \sigma_2^2\$ 
- Alternative Hypothesis $\ H_a: \sigma_1^2 < \sigma_2^2\$

Based on the vignette, we have the following information:
- $\bar{x}_{\text{new}} = \bar{x}_1 = 246$
- $\bar{x}_{\text{old}} = \bar{x}_2 = 240$
- $s_{\text{new}} = s_1 = 15.6$
- $s_{\text{old}} = s_2 = 28.2$

Since we are comparing two different variances, we have to use the **F-test**.

Compute the f-value with the following formula:

$$
F = \frac{s_2^2}{s_1^2} = \frac{(28.2)^2}{(15.6)^2} = 3.27
$$

The degree of freedom ($df$) for both dataset is:

$df_1 = n_1 - 1 = 30 - 1 = 29 = df_2$

Since we **cannot** calculate the exact p-value, we use the approximation from the provided table instead:
The critical value of F when $df_1 = 29 , df_2 = 30 (F_{29, 30, \alpha}$ are as follows:
$F_{, 8}
