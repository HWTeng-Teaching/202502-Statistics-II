### (Possible Incomprehensive question)
According to DeepSeek and ChatGPT, there is one empirical rule of thumb formula, as follows:

$$
\alpha \approx \frac{2}{n_1+n_2}
$$

#### Why is this formula reasonable?

1. **Significance Level in Small Sample Situations**:
   - In small sample situations, the power of statistical tests is low, so the significance level $\alpha$ is usually higher.
   - The formula reflects that: when the sample sizes $n_1$ and $n_2$ are small, $\alpha$ will be larger; as the sample sizes increase, $\alpha$ will gradually decrease.

2. **Origin of the Empirical Rule**:
   - Such formulas are usually based on the experience of statisticians or simulation results. For example, in practical applications, when sample sizes are small, the significance level $\alpha$ is often set higher to avoid overly strict tests that result in failing to reject the null hypothesis.
   - The "2" in the formula is an empirical constant used to adjust the range of the significance level.

3. **Relationship with Formal Statistical Methods**:
   - This formula is not a formal statistical method but a simplified estimation tool.
   - Formal statistical methods (such as the f-test) calculate the significance level based on sample sizes, degrees of freedom, and the properties of the f-distribution, yielding more precise results.

#### Applicability of this Formula
- **Suitable for Small Samples**: This formula is particularly suitable for situations with small sample sizes (e.g., $n_1$ and $n_2$ are both less than 10).
- **Not Suitable for Large Samples**: When sample sizes are large, this formula will underestimate the significance level $\alpha$, as $\alpha$ typically approaches a smaller value (such as 0.05 or 0.01).

So, we could approximate $\alpha$ using the empirical formula:

$$
\alpha \approx \frac{2}{n_1+n_2} = \frac{2}{4+3} \approx 0.285714
$$
