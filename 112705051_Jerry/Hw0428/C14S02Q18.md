## Question 18
We first set up the hypotheses:
- $H_0: p_1 = p_2 = p_3 = \frac{1}{3}$
- $H_a: \exists i \neq j$ s.t. $p_i \neq p_j$

Now we calculate the expected number of people for each entrance ( $i \in [1,3]$):

$$
E_i = n \times p_i = 200 \times \frac{1}{3} \approx 66.67 
$$

We now compute the Chi-Square Statistic using the below formula:

$$
X^2 = \sum \frac{(O_i^2}{E_i} - n = \frac{83^2}{66.67} + \frac{61^2}{66.67}+ \frac{56^2}{66.67} - 200 \approx 6.18
$$

The critical value with $df = 3 - 1 =2$ is

$$
\chi^2_{0.05, 2} = 5.991 < 6.18 
$$

Since the calculated value is larger than the critical value, we then **reject the null hypothesis**, encapsulating that the **preferences are not equal**.

Now we calculate the 95% confidence interval for entrance one:

$$
C.I. = \hat{p_1} \pm 1.96 \times \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p_1} \times (1-\hat{p_1})}{n}} = 0.415 \pm 1.96 \times \sqrt{\frac{0.415(1-0.415)}{200}} = 0.415 \pm 0.068 = (0.347, 0.483)
$$

Therefore, we are 95% confident that the true proportion of people favoring entrance 1 lies between 34.7% and 48.3%.
Also, since $\frac{1}{3} \approx 0.33$ is **not** included in the 95% confidence interval, we may infer that $p_i \neq \frac{1}{3}$ for any values of i between $[1,3]$, 
which cooresponds to our conclusion when using the chi-square test.
