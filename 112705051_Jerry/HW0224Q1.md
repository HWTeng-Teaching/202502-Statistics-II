# Question 13

A **Q-Q plot (Quantile-Quantile Plot)** is a graphical method to check whether a dataset follows a specific theoretical distribution, normal distribution in this case.

- **X-axis (Data)**: Represents the observed values, sorted in ascending order.
- **Y-axis (Percent/Quantiles of Normal Distribution)**: Represents the theoretical quantiles from a standard normal distribution corresponding to the same percentile positions as the data points.

If the data points closely **follow the blue diagonal line** and **do not have significant deviations**, it suggests that the dataset is approximately normal. 

From the graph in the question, we can observe that:
- The **red data points** align closely with the **blue reference line**.
- There are **no significant deviations, bends, or S-shaped patterns** that would indicate skewness or heavy/light tails.

From the statement and our observation, it suggests that the sample data is **approximately normal**.
