# Question 13

A **Q-Q plot (Quantile-Quantile Plot)** is a graphical method to check whether a dataset follows a specific theoretical distribution, normal distribution in this case.

- **X-axis (Data)**: Represents the observed values, sorted in ascending order.
- **Y-axis (Percent/Quantiles of Normal Distribution)**: Represents the theoretical quantiles from a standard normal distribution corresponding to the same percentile positions as the data points.

If the data points closely **follow the blue diagonal line** and **do not have significant deviations**, it suggests that the dataset is approximately normal. 

From the graph in the question, we can observe that:
- The **red data points** align closely with the **blue reference line**.
- There are **no significant deviations, bends, or S-shaped patterns** that would indicate skewness or heavy/light tails.

From the statement and our observation, it suggests that the sample data is **approximately normal**.

# Question 14

From question no.13, we conclude that:
If the data follows a normal distribution:
1. The points should form a straight diagonal line.
2. There are no significant deviations.
  
Indicators of non-normality in the graph:
1. **Curvature** (S-shape) → Suggests skewness.
2. **Extreme deviations at tails** → Indicates long-tailed distributions.
3. **Clusters of points** → Suggests multimodal distribution.

From the statement and our observation, it suggests that the sample data is **approximately non-normal**.

# Question 15

The "Percent" on the Y-axis of a Q-Q plot represents the **cumulative probability (percentile rank)** of each data point under the assumption of a normal distribution.

Each data point in the dataset is matched to its expected position in a normal distribution:  
- Smaller values correspond to lower percentiles.  
- The median value aligns with the **50th percentile**.  
- Larger values correspond to higher percentiles.  

These percentiles are converted into **Z-scores** (standard normal quantiles) using the inverse normal distribution function.

From the graph, we can notice two things:
- Symmetry of the Data  
  - The median (the line inside the box) is roughly centered within the box, indicating that the data is 
  approximately symmetric.  
  - The whiskers on both sides are of similar length, showing no significant skewness.  

- Outliers  
  - There are no apparent outliers in the box plot.  
  - This suggests that the data is not influenced by extreme values.  

Based on our discoveries, it suggests that the sample data is **approximately normal**.
