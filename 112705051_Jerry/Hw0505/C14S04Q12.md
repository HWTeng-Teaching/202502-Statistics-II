## Question 12
First we set up the hypotheses:
- Null hypothesis $H_0$: Family size distribution is independent of the type of residence.
- Alternative hypothesis $H_a$: Family size distribution depends on the type of residence.

We now organize the data into the contingency table:
| Family Members   | Apartment | Duplex | Single Residence | Row Total |
| ---------------- | --------- | ------ | ---------------- | --------- |
| 1                | 8         | 20     | 1                | **29**        |
| 2                | 16        | 8      | 9                | **33**      |
| 3                | 10        | 10     | 14               | **34**      |
| 4 or More        | 6         | 2      | 16               | **24**      |
| **Column Total** | **40**    | **40** | **40**           | **120**   |

**Step 3: Compute Expected Counts**

Since each column total is 40 and grand total is 120, expected counts:

$$
E_{ij} = \frac{(\text{Row Total}) \times 40}{120} = \frac{\text{Row Total}}{3}
$$

We now compute the chi-square test statistic:

$$
\chi^2 = \sum \frac{(O - E)^2}{E} \approx 27.63
$$

The critical value with $df = (4 - 1)(3 - 1) = 6$ is

$$
\chi^2_{0.01, 6} = 16.812 <27.63 
$$

Since:

$$
\chi^2 = 27.63 > 16.812
$$

We **reject the null hypothesis**, showing that there is strong evidence to suggest that family size distribution is not independent of the type of residence. This indicates a significant association between household size and the kind of residence.
