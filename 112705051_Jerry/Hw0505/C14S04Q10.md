## Question 10
First we set up the hypotheses:
- Null hypothesis $H_0$: Marital status is independent of educational level.
- Alternative hypothesis $H_a$: Marital status is dependent on educational level.

We now organize the data into a contingency table:

| Educational Level   | Married (Yes) | Not Married (No) | Row Total |
| ------------------- | ------------- | ---------------- | --------- |
| Bachelors or Higher | 187           | 113              | **300**       |
| Some College        | 162           | 138              | **300**       |
| High School or Less | 149           | 151              | **300**     |
| **Column Total**    | **498**       | **402**          | **900**   |

**Step 3: Compute Expected Counts**

For each cell, the expected count is:

$$
E_{ij} = \frac{(\text{Row Total}) \times (\text{Column Total})}{\text{Grand Total}} = \frac{300 \times 498}{900} = 166 \text{ (for "Married" in each row)}
$$

$$
E_{ij} = \frac{300 \times 402}{900} = 134 \text{ (for "Not Married" in each row)}
$$

Now we compute the chi-square test statistic:

$$
\chi^2 = \sum \frac{(O_i - E)^2}{E} \approx 10.07
$$

The critical value with $df = (3 - 1)(2 - 1) = 2 $ is

$$
\chi^2_{0.01, 2} = 9.210 < 10.07 
$$

Since the test statistic $\chi^2 ≈ 10.07 > 9.210$, we **reject the null hypothesis**, therefore suggesting that that marriage rates do **vary significantly** among adults with different levels of education.
