## Question 23
We first set up the hypotheses:
- **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)**: The distribution of causes of death at this hospital follows the same proportions as the general population.
- **Alternative Hypothesis ($H_a$)**: The distribution of causes of death at this hospital differs from the general population.

Multiply each proportion by total deaths $n = 308$ to get the expected counts:

| Cause               | Proportion | Expected Count ($E$)         | Observed Count ($O$) |
| ------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Heart Disease       | 0.234      | $0.234 \times 308 = 72.072$  | 78                   |
| Cancer              | 0.225      | $0.225 \times 308 = 69.3$    | 81                   |
| Respiratory Disease | 0.056      | $0.056 \times 308 = 17.248$  | 28                   |
| Stroke              | 0.051      | $0.051 \times 308 = 15.708$  | 16                   |
| Other               | 0.434      | $0.434 \times 308 = 133.672$ | 105                  |

Now we calculate the chi-square test statistic:

$$
\chi^2 = \sum \frac{(O_i - E)^2}{E} \approx 15.414
$$

With $df = 5 - 1 = 4$ and $\alpha = 0.05$, the p-value is:

$$
\text{p-value} = P(\chi^2 > 15.414) \approx 0.0039 < \alpha = 0.05
$$

Since the calculated p-value does not exceed the value of $\alpha$, we **reject the null hypotheses, stating that there is sufficient evidence to conclude that the distribution of causes of death at this hospital differs significantly from the population distribution.
