## Question 12

#### Part (a)
We first rank up all the observed information and form into a table below:

|data|rank|type|
|----|----|----|
|4.7 |1   |below|
|4.8 |2.5 |above|
|4.8 |2.5 |below|
|4.9 |5   |above|
|4.9 |5   |below|
|4.9 |5   |below|
|5.0 |7.5 |above|
|5.0 |7.5 |below|
|5.1 |9   |above|
|5.2 |10  |above|

Now we set up the hypotheses:
- $H_0$: The dissolved oxygen levels above and below the town are the same.
- $H_a$: The dissolved oxygen levels above the town are higher than below the town (one-tailed test).

- The rank sum for "above town" = $T_1$ = 2.5 + 5 + 7.5 + 9 +10 = 34
- The **reversed** rank sum for "above town" = $T*_1$ = $n_1 \times (n_1 + n_2 +1)-T_1 = 5 \times 11 - 34 = 21$

Therefore, the test statistic $t = min(T_1, T*_1) = min(34,55) = 34$


With $(n_1, n_2) = (5,5)$, and a single-tailed test, we find the critical values with $\alpha=0.05$ equals to 20
Since the critical value does **not** exceed the observed t, we **fail to reject $H_0$**, stating that there is not enough evidence
to conclude that dissolved oxygen levels above the town are significantly higher than below the town using the Wilcoxon rank sum test.

#### Part (b)
We now set up the hypotheses for students's t-test:
- $H_0$: $\mu_{\text{Above}} = \mu_{\text{Below}}$  
- $H_1$: $\mu_{\text{Above}} > \mu_{\text{Below}}$ (one-tailed)  

For "Above Town":  
- Mean $\bar{X}_A$ = $\frac{1}{5} \times (4.8 + 5.2 + 5.0 + 4.9 + 5.1) = 5.0$  
- Variance = $s_A^2$ = $\frac{1}{5} \sum (X- \bar{X}_A)^2 = 0.02$

For "Below Town":  
- Mean $\bar{X}_B$ = $\frac{1}{5} \times (5.0+4.7+4.9+4.8+4.9) = 4.86$  
- Variance = $s_B^2$ = $\frac{1}{5} \sum (X- \bar{X}_B)^2 = 0.0104$ 

Assuming equal variances using the rule of thumb:

$$
s_p^2 = \frac{(n_A - 1)s_A^2 + (n_B - 1)s_B^2}{n_A + n_B - 2} = \frac{4(0.02) + 4(0.0104)}{8} = 0.0152
$$  

$$
t = \frac{\bar{X}_A - \bar{X}_B}{\sqrt{s_p^2 \left(\frac{1}{n_A} + \frac{1}{n_B}\right)}} = \frac{5.0 - 4.86}{\sqrt{0.0152 \left(\frac{2}{5}\right)}} \approx 1.795
$$  

Degrees of freedom = $n_A + n_B - 2 = 8$.  
For $\alpha = 0.05$, $df = 8$, and a single-tailed test, the critical value = 1.860.
Since $t = 1.795 < 1.86$, we **fail to reject $H_0$**.  
Therefore, there is not enough evidence
to conclude that dissolved oxygen levels above the town are significantly higher than below the town using the Wilcoxon rank sum test.
