## Question 4

First, we establish the following table:
| Population | Pair 1 | Pair 2 | Pair 3 | Pair 4 | Pair 5 | Pair 6 | Pair 7 |
|------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 1          | 8.9    | 8.1    | 9.3    | 7.7    | 10.4   | 8.3    | 7.4    |
| 2          | 8.8    | 7.4    | 9.0    | 7.8    | 9.9    | 8.1    | 6.9    |
|sign of difference  | +    | + | +    | -   | +    | +   | +    |

- Number of positive signs $S_+$: 6  
- Number of negative signs $S_-$: 1  
 
Now we set up the hypotheses:
- $H_0$: The two population distributions are identical.
- $H_a$: The two population distributions are not identical.

We use the p-value approach:

The p-value is the probability of observing $S \leq 1$ under $H_0$ (two-tailed):  

$$
p = 2 \times P(S \leq 1) = 2 \times (P(S = 0) + P(S = 1)) = 2 \times (\binom{7}{0} (0.5)^7 + \binom{7}{1} (0.5)^6 (0.5)^1) = 2 \times 0.0625 = 0.125
$$

Since the calculated p-value **exceeds** the $\alpha = 0.10$, we **cannot reject the null hypothesis**. Encapsulating that there is no significant evidence of a difference between the two populations.
