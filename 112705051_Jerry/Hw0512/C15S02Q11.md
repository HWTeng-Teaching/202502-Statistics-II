## Question 11
#### Part (a)
<details>
  <summary><strong>Data Chart</strong></summary>
  
  We first set up the following chart: (Difference = Chef A - Chef B)
|Meal|Chef A|Chef B|Difference|Sign of difference|
|----|------|------|----------|------------------|
|1   |6     |8     | 2        |-                 |    
|2   |4     |5     | 1        |-                 |     
|3   |7     |4     | 3        |+                 |    
|4   |8     |7     | 1        |+                 |    
|5   |2     |3     | 1        |-                 |    
|6   |7     |4     | 3        |+                 |    
|7   |9     |9     | 0        |0                 |    
|8   |7     |8     | 1        |-                 | 
|9   |2     |5     | 3        |-                 | 
|10  |4     |3     | 1        |+                 | 
|11  |6     |9     | 3        |-                 | 
|12  |8     |5     | 3        |+                 |
|13  |4     |2     | 2        |+                 | 
|14  |3     |3     | 0        |0                 | 
|15  |6     |8     | 2        |-                 | 
|16  |9     |10    | 1        |-                 | 
|17  |9     |8     | 1        |+                 | 
|18  |4     |6     | 2        |-                 | 
|19  |4     |3     | 1        |+                 | 
|20  |5     |4     | 1        |+                 | 
|21  |3     |2     | 1        |+                 | 
|22  |5     |3     | 2        |+                 |

First, we'll compare each pair of ratings and count how many times Chef A's rating is higher than Chef B's, and vice versa. We'll ignore ties.

After counting, we can see that:
- Chef A higher: 11 times
- Chef B higher: 9 times
- Ties: 2 times (meals 7 and 14)
 
We ignore the 2 ties, leaving us with n = 20 non-tied pairs.

Now we set up the hypotheses:
- $H_0$: $P(A > B) = P(B > A) = 0.5$
- $H_a$: $P(A > B) \neq P(B < A)$

For $n=20$ and $p=0.5$, using binomial tables, the critical values for $\frac{\alpha}{2} \approx 0.025$ (two-tailed) are roughly:
- Lower critical value: 5 (P(X ≤ 5) ≈ 0.021)
- Upper critical value: 15 (P(X ≥ 15) ≈ 0.021)
(Rounded for table limitations)
  
Therefore, the rejection region is:


$$
R.R. = \lbrace X \mid X \in (0,5] \cup [15,20) \rbrace
$$

Since the observed count for Chef A higher is 11, which is not in the rejection region (5 < 11 < 15). Therefore, we **fail to reject** $H_0$.

#### Part (b)
The formula for calculating large-sample test statistics:

$$
z = \frac{x-np}{\sqrt{np(1-p)}}
$$

With $x=11$, $n=20$, $p=0.5$,

$$
z = \frac{11-20 \times 0.5}{\sqrt{20 \times 0.5^2}} = 0.447
$$

Now we find the critical value, with $\alpha = 0.05$ and a two-sided test:

$$
Z_{0.025} = 1.96
$$

Since the calculated value = 0.447, which does **not** exceed the critical value, we **cannot reject the null hypothesis**.

#### Part (c)
Both methods lead to the same conclusion: we fail to reject the null hypothesis at $\alpha = 0.05$. There is not sufficient evidence to conclude that one chef tends to give higher ratings than the other.
