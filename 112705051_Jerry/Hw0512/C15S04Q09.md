## Question 9
### Part (a)

<details>
  <summary><strong>Original Table</strong></summary>

| Pair Number | Population 1 | Population 2 | Difference = Population 1-2 |
|----------|-------|-------|--------------------------|
| 1        | 8.9   | 8.8   | 0.1                      |
| 2        | 8.1   | 7.4   | 0.7                      |
| 3        | 9.3   | 9.0   | 0.3                      |
| 4        | 7.7   | 7.8   | -0.1                     |
| 5        | 10.4  | 9.9   | 0.5                      |
| 6        | 8.3   | 8.1   | 0.2                      |
| 7        | 7.4   | 6.9   | 0.5                      |
</details>

Now we calculate the absolute value and rank, therefore creating the following table:

| Pair Number | difference | \|d\| | rank |
|----------|----------|----------------|------|
| 1        | 0.1      | 0.1            | 1.5    |
| 2        | 0.7      | 0.7            | 7    |
| 3        | 0.3      | 0.3            | 4    |
| 4        | -0.1     | 0.1            | 1.5    |
| 5        | 0.5      | 0.5            | 5.5  |
| 6        | 0.2      | 0.2            | 3    |
| 7        | 0.5      | 0.5            | 5.5  |

Compute signed rank sums:
- Positive rank sum = $W^{+} = 1.5 (Pair ~~ 1) + 7 (Pair ~~ 2) + 4 (Pair ~~ 3) + 5.5 (Pair ~~ 5) + 3 (Pair ~~ 6) + 5.5 (Pair ~~ 7)= 26.5$
- Negative rank sum = $W^{-} = 1.5 (Pair ~~ 4)$

Set up the hypotheses:
- $H_0$: The two population medians are equal ($M_{d_1} = M_{d_2}$)
- $H_a$: The two population medians are different ($M_{d_1} \neq M_{d_2}$)

$\Rightarrow$ Test Statistic: $W = min(W^{+}, W^{-}) = 1.5$

Looking up for critical value from the Wilcoxon signed-rank table, we find that with
$n=7$, $\alpha =0.05$, and double-tailed test, the critical value = 2.

Since the calculated W = 1.5 < 2, we reject H₀. Encapsulating that there is significant evidence of a difference between the two populations.

### Part (b)
First, we establish the following table:
| Pair # | Population 1 | Population 2 | Difference (d = Pop1 - Pop2) | Sign |
| ------ | ------------ | ------------ | ---------------------------- | ---- |
| 1      | 8.9          | 8.8          | 0.1                          | +    |
| 2      | 8.1          | 7.4          | 0.7                          | +    |
| 3      | 9.3          | 9.0          | 0.3                          | +    |
| 4      | 7.7          | 7.8          | -0.1                         | –    |
| 5      | 10.4         | 9.9          | 0.5                          | +    |
| 6      | 8.3          | 8.1          | 0.2                          | +    |
| 7      | 7.4          | 6.9          | 0.5                          | +    |


- Number of positive signs $S_+$: 6  
- Number of negative signs $S_-$: 1  
 
Now we set up the hypotheses:
- $H_0$: The two population distributions are identical.
- $H_a$: The two population distributions are not identical.

We use the p-value approach:

The p-value is the probability of observing $S \leq 1$ under $H_0$ (two-tailed):  

$$
p = 2 \times P(S \leq 1) = 2 \times (P(S = 0) + P(S = 1)) = 2 \times (\binom{7}{0} (0.5)^7 + \binom{7}{1} (0.5)^6 (0.5)^1) = 2 \times 0.0625 = 0.125
$$

Since the calculated p-value **exceeds** the $\alpha = 0.10$, we **cannot reject the null hypothesis**. Encapsulating that there is no significant evidence of a difference between the two populations.

### Part (c)
The observed difference in conclusions arises from the use of **different nonparametric tests** in the two contexts:

* **Section 15.2** employs the **Sign Test**, which only considers the direction (sign) of the paired differences. This method is **more conservative**, as it ignores the magnitude of the differences.
* **Problem 9 (Part A)** applies the **Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test**, which is **more sensitive** because it incorporates both the direction and the **magnitude** of the differences through ranked absolute values.

As a result:

* The **Wilcoxon test** yields a **significant result at the 0.05 level**, detecting a statistically significant difference between the paired samples.
* The **Sign Test**, however, **does not reach significance even at the 0.10 level**, due to its lower statistical power.

This discrepancy exemplifies a key principle in nonparametric hypothesis testing:

> **The more information a test utilizes, the greater its statistical power.**
