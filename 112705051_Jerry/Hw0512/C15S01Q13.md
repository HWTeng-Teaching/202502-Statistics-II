## Question 13
We first set up the hypotheses:
- $H_0$: The distributions of eye-movement rates are the same for deaf and hearing children.
- $H_a$: The distributions of eye-movement rates differ between deaf and hearing children (two-tailed test).

Now we calculate $T_1$ and $T*_1$:(the first group represents children who are deaf)

$$
T_1 = 15+11+18+10+14+12+17+16+13= 126
$$

Then,

$$
T^{*}_1 = n_1 \times (n_1+n_2+1) - T_1 = 9 \times (9+9+1) -126 = 45
$$

We now get the test statistic $t=min(T_1, T*_1) = 45$
The critical value for a two-sided test, with $\alpha = 0.05$, and $(n_1, n_2)=(9,9)$, the critical value = 62
Since the test statistic does **not** exceed the critical value, we **reject the null hypothesis**, therefore, The distributions of eye-movement rates for deaf and hearing children are significantly different. Deaf children exhibit higher eye-movement rates.
