- After counting and summing, the results show that:
  - Positive signs (+): 8 cases (Drug B better)
  - Negative signs (-): 2 cases (Drug A better)
  - Ties: 0 cases

- We now set up the hypotheses:
  - $H_0~$: $p(+) = p(-) = 0.5$ $\~$ $i.e.$ $\~$ there are no difference between drugs
  - $H_a~$: $p(+) > 0.5$ $\~$ $i.e.$ $\~$ drug B has higher recovery rate
  - The desired rejection region: $R.R. = \lbrace S \geq k \rbrace$
  - Set S as the number of positive signs, and S satisfies: $S \sim Bin(10,0.5)$

- For $n =10$ (excluding no ties) and $p=0.5$:
  - After seeking the binomial table, we get that:
 
$$
P(S \geq 8) = 1-P(S \leq 7) = 1 - 0.945 = 0.055 > 0.05 = \alpha
$$

For statistically rigorous results, we can set $k=9$

- Remarks:
  - We can also use `=CRITBINOM(10, 0.5, 0.95) + 1` to get 9, since $P(X \geq 8) \approx 0.055 > 0.05 = \alpha$
  - In mathematics, the binomial distribution is **discrete**, meaning that $X$ can only take integer values from 0 to $n$, so probabilities like $P(X \geq k)$ are **only meaningful when $k$ is an integer**.
  - Using $k=8$ is more liberal, while using $k=9$ is more conservative.
  - We can also use the following formula for calculating $P(X \geq 8)$:

$$
P(X \geq 8) = \frac{\binom{10}{8}+\binom{10}{9}+\binom{10}{10}}{2^{10}} = \frac{45+10+1}{1024} \approx 0.0547 - ①
$$

and 

$$
P(X \geq 9) = \frac{10+1}{1024}\approx0.0107 - ②
$$

From ①②, we can know that $8 \le k \le 9$, for precision, we choose $k=9$

⇒The rejection region is:

$$
R.R. = \lbrace S \geq 9 \rbrace 
$$

### Part (b)
The Student's t-test would be inappropriate for this analysis because:

- **Non-Normal Data**: The recovery rates are percentages (bounded between 0-100%) and may not follow a normal distribution, violating a key assumption of the t-test.
  - t-test assumes continuous, normally distributed data, but this study uses recovery rates (percentages), which are proportional data with critical limitations:
    - Bounded range (0%-100%), violating the normal distribution's infinite range assumption
    - Severe skewness when proportions approach 0% or 100%
      
- **Paired Binary Outcomes**: The data represents counts of recoveries (binary outcomes) within different sample sizes at each hospital, making the t-test's assumptions about continuous data problematic.
  - **Heteroscedasticity**: t-test assumes equal variance, but smaller hospitals show greater volatility
  - **Unequal weighting**: t-test treats all hospitals equally despite reliability differences

- **Small Sample Size**: Since we only have 10 hospitals to compare, the power is limited. Typically, the sample size have to exceed 15 or 20 in order to ensure reliable results and reduce the influence of outliers or random noise.
