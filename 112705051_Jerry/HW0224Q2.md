### Question 20
We currently have the information and data below:
- Population mean: $\mu = 74$
- Sample size: $n = 25$
- Sample mean: $\bar{x} = 69.7$
- Sample standard deviation: $s = 16$
- Significance level: $\alpha = 0.05$
- Hypotheses:
  - $H_0 : \mu = 74$
  - $H_A : \mu \neq 74$ (suggests a two-tailed test)

The test statistic for a single sample mean follows:

$$
t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{s / \sqrt{n}}
$$

Substituting the given values:

$$
t = \frac{69.7 - 74}{16 / \sqrt{25}} = \frac{-4.3}{3.2} \approx -1.34
$$

Degrees of freedom df = n - 1 = 25 - 1 = 24

From the t-table, for $\alpha = 0.05$ in a two-tailed test:

$$
t_{0.025,24} \approx \pm 2.064

Since:

$$|t| = 1.34 < 2.064$$

We fail to reject $H_0$.

### Conclusion
There is **not enough evidence** at the 5% significance level to conclude that the mean cerebral blood flow in stroke patients is different from that of healthy individuals.
