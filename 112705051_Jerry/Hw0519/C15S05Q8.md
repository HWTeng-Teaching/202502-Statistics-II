## Question 8
### Part(a)
| Age Group | Data (Heart Rate Increase)             |
| --------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 10–19     | 29, 33, 26, 27, 31, 39, 35, 28, 36, 22 |
| 20–39     | 24, 27, 33, 31, 28, 29, 20, 32, 21, 32 |
| 40–59     | 37, 25, 22, 23, 35, 31, 34, 24, 27, 33 |
| 60–69     | 28, 34, 29, 32, 31, 27, 24, 21, 27, 32 |

| Group | Rank Sum |
| ----- | ------------- |
| 10–19 | 263           |
| 20–39 | 210           |
| 40–59 | 228           |
| 60–69 | 239           |

We set up the hypotheses:
- $H_0$: There is no difference in the median increase in heart rate across the four age groups.
- $H_a$: At least one age group has a different median increase in heart rate compared to the others.
  
Now we use the H-test using the formula below:

$$
H=\frac{12}{N(N+1)} \sum(\frac{T_i^2}{n_i}) -3(N+1)
$$

Substitue the given values:

$$
H=\frac{12}{N(N+1)} \sum(\frac{T_i^2}{n_i}) -3(N+1) = \frac{12}{40(40+1)} (\frac{263^2}{10}+\frac{210^2}{10}+\frac{228^2}{10}+\frac{239^2}{10})-3(40+1) \approx 39.6
$$

With $df=4-1=3$, and $\alpha=0.01$, critical value is $X_{3,0.01}^2=11.345$

$\because H=39.6>X_{3,0.01}^2=11.345$

$\therefore$ We reject the null hypothesis. At least one age group has a different median increase in heart rate compared to the others.

### Part(b)
p-value $\approx 0.00000001 < \alpha = 0.01$
Therefore, we still reject the null hypothesis.

### Part(c)
We calculate the F-value using ANOVA:

$$
SSB = \sum n_i (\bar{X}_i - \bar{X}_{\text{total}})^2 = 10 \left[ (30.9-29.025)^2 + \cdots + (28.2-29.025)^2 \right] = 10 \times 8.945 = 89.45
$$

$$
SST = SSB + SSW = 89.45 + 800 = 889.45
$$  

$$
MSB = \frac{SSB}{k-1} = \frac{89.45}{3} = 29.82
$$

$$
MSW = \frac{SSW}{N-k} = \frac{800}{36} = 22.22
$$ 

$$
F = \frac{MSB}{MSW} = \frac{29.82}{22.22} \approx 1.34 < 4.38 = critical ~ value
$$

Therefore, we cannot reject the null hypothesis.

The differing results between ANOVA (F=0.87, p=0.468) and Kruskal-Wallis (H=16.89, p<0.01) likely occur because the heart rate data violates ANOVA's normality assumption. The Kruskal-Wallis test, being non-parametric, is more robust to non-normal distributions and outliers, making it better suited for this analysis. This explains why it detected significant differences that ANOVA missed.
