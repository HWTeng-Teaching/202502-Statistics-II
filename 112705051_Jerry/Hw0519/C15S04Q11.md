## Quesiton 11
### Part(a)
We first establish the following table:
| Month | A  | B  | Difference ($d = A - B$) | $\lvert d  \rvert$ | Rank | Sign-Rank |
|------|----|----|---------------------|--------|------------|--------------|
| 1    | 3  | 7  | -4                  | 4      | 5          | -5           |
| 2    | 14 | 12 | 2                   | 2      | 3          | +3           |
| 3    | 7  | 9  | -2                  | 2      | 3          | -3           |
| 4    | 10 | 15 | -5                  | 5      | 6          | -6           |
| 5    | 9  | 12 | -3                  | 3      | 4          | -4           |
| 6    | 6  | 6  | 0                   | —      | —          | —            |
| 7    | 13 | 12 | 1                   | 1      | 1.5        | +1.5         |
| 8    | 6  | 5  | 1                   | 1      | 1.5        | +1.5         |
| 9    | 7  | 13 | -6                  | 6      | 7          | -7           |

Now we sum up the amount of different signs:
- Sum of ranks for positive differences ($W^+$): $3+1.5+1.5=6$
- Sum of ranks for negative differences ($W^-$): $5+3+6+4+7=25$
- Ties: 1(month 6)
  
$\Rightarrow W=min(W^+, W^-)=(6,25)=6$

Set up the hypotheses:
- $H_0$: Monthly breakdown rates between two machines does not differ $~ i.e. ~ \mu_1=\mu_2$
- $H_a$: Monthly breakdown rates between two machines does differ $~ i.e. ~ \mu_1 \neq \mu_2$
- This suggests a double-tailed test
  
With $n=9-1=8$, $\alpha=0.05$, the critical value=4

Since the calculated $W=6>4=critical~value$, we **cannot reject the null hypotheses**, meaning that we cannot assert there's a difference between two machines.

### Part(b)
Possible reasons are as follows:

- **Different usage frequency**: Although the machines are of the same model, one might be used more frequently, leading to a higher chance of malfunction.
- **Different operators**: Different operators may have varying usage habits, which can affect the failure rate.
- **Different maintenance schedules**: One machine might receive more regular maintenance, resulting in better performance.
- **Environmental factors**: The machines might be located in areas with different temperature, humidity, or vibration conditions.
- **Random variation**: Even under identical conditions, differences may arise due to randomness.
