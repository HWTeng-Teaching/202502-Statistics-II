**Three Testing Procedures:**
- Paired t-test (parametric)
- Wilcoxon signed-rank test (non-parametric)
- Sign test (non-parametric)

**Assumptions for Paired t-test:**
- The differences between pairs are normally distributed
- The observations are paired and independent
- The data is measured on at least an interval scale

**Checking Assumptions:**

The parametric paired t-test assumes normality of differences. Looking at the data:
- The differences appear to be mostly positive (imagery scores higher)
- There are some extreme differences (e.g., Student 1: +15, Student 15: +17)
- A normality test would be needed to confirm, but the presence of several large differences suggests the distribution may not be perfectly normal
  
Conclusion: The data may not fully satisfy the normality assumption, making non-parametric tests potentially more appropriate.

### Part(b)
We first set up the null hypotheses:
- $H_0$: There is no difference in recall scores between the two conditions.
- $H_a$: There is a difference in recall scores between the two conditions.
- This suggests a double-tailed test.

#### Sign test:
After counting, we see that:
- There are 20 positive signs
- There are 0 negative signs

We now use the p-value approach:

$$
p-value = 2P(x<=0) \approx 0 < 0.05 = \alpha
$$

Therefore, we **reject the null hypothesis**

#### Sign-Rank Test:
We sum up the amount of different signs:
- Sum of ranks for positive differences ($W^+$): $1+2+...+20=210$
- Sum of ranks for negative differences ($W^-$): 0
- Ties: 0

$\Rightarrow W=min(W^+, W^-)=(210,0)=0$

With $n=20$, $\alpha=0.05$, the critical value is certainly positve, which is a lot bigger than 0.
Therefore, we **reject the null hypotheses**

### Part(c)
Both tests reached the same conclusion - rejecting the null hypothesis in favor of imagery having an effect on recall. However:
The consistency between tests reinforces the conclusion that imagery instructions significantly improve word recall compared to no imagery instructions. The unanimous positive differences make this an especially clear case.
