## Question 6

| Training Period (hours) | Child 1 | Child 2 | Child 3 | Child 4 | Child 5 |
|-------------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| 0.5                     | 8       | 14      | 9       | 12      | 10      |
| 1.0                     | 9       | 7       | 5       | 8       | 9       |
| 1.5                     | 4       | 6       | 7       | 8       | 6       |
| 2.0                     | 4       | 7       | 5       | 5       | 4       |

| Training Period (Group) | Rank Value          | Rank Sum |
| ----------------------- | ------------------- | ------- |
| 0.5                     | 13, 16, 18, 19, 20  | 86      |
| 1.0                     | 5, 10, 13, 16, 16   | 60      |
| 1.5                     | 2, 7.5, 7.5, 10, 13 | 40      |
| 2.0                     | 2, 2, 5, 5, 10      | 24      |

We set up the hypotheses:
- $H_0$: There is no difference in the distribution of assembly times across the four training periods.
- $H_a$: At least one training period results in a different distribution of assembly times compared to the others.
  
Now we use the H-test using the formula below:

$$
H=\frac{12}{N(N+1)} \sum(\frac{T_i^2}{n_i}) -3(N+1)
$$

Substitue the given values:

$$
H=\frac{12}{N(N+1)} \sum(\frac{T_i^2}{n_i}) -3(N+1) = \frac{12}{20(20+1)} (\frac{86^2}{5}+\frac{60^2}{5}+\frac{40^2}{5}+\frac{24^2}{5})-3(20+1) \approx 12.09 
$$

With $df=4-1=3$, and $\alpha=0.01$, critical value is $X_{3,0.01}^2=11.345$

$\because H=12.09>X_{3,0.01}^2=11.345$

$\therefore$ We reject the null hypothesis.
