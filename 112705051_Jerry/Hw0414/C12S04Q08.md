### Question 8
#### Part (a)
The random error ε must be independent with each other and should be obtained from a normal distribution with mean 0 and a common variance $\sigma^2$

### Part (b)
The best estimate of $\sigma^2$ is the **Mean Square Error (MSE)**: $\sigma^2 \approx \text{MSE} = 58.05$

### Part (c)
The normal probability plot shows a slight departure from normality in the tails.  
The residual plot may include one unusual point, but no major violations of regression assumptions are evident.  
Thus, the model appears reasonably appropriate for the data.
