### Question 10
#### Part (a)
We first set $\ \hat{y}= a + b x \$

Calculate the variances:
- $\ S_{xx} = 700 \$  
- $\ S_{yy} = 1146.249 \$
- $\ S_{xy} = -876 \$

Therefore, we can find the slope $\beta$ equals to:

$$ 
\beta= \frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}} = -1.251 
$$ 

Thus, the intercept $\alpha$ is

$$
\alpha = \bar{y} - b \bar{x}  , a = 47.314 - (-1.251)\times 37 = 93.597 
$$

$\ \Rightarrow \hat{y} = 93.596+(1.251)x \$

#### Part (b) 
We first set up the hypotheses:
-  $\ H_0 :\beta = 0 \$
-  $\ H_a :\beta \neq 0 \$

Caculate sum of regression and total sum of squares:
-  $\ SSR = \frac{(S_{xy})^2}{S_{xx}} = 1096.251\$
- $\ Total SS = S_{yy} = 1146.249 \$

Since $df_regression = 1, df_error = n - 2$, we obtained the following results:
- $\ SSE = 1146.249 - 1096.251 = 49.998 \$
- $\ MSE = SSE/(n-2) = 49.998/5 = 9.9995 \$
-  $\ t = \frac{-1.25-0}{\sqrt{\frac{9.9995}{700}}} = -10.4669 \$

  Since $-10.4669 << -2.571 = t_{5,0.025}$
  
  $\ \Rightarrow \$
  We reject $\ H_0 \$ ,indicating that there is a linear relationship

#### Part(c) 

$$
C.I. = \text{Slope} \pm t_{\text{critical}} \times \text{Standard Error} -1.25 \pm 2.571 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{9.995}{700}} = (-1.5582,-0.9437)
$$

since the interval doesn't contain 0, there is a linear relationship between x and y.

## d. 
$\ r^2 = \frac{SSR}{Total SS} = \frac{1096.251}{1146.249} = 0.9564 \$

Therefore, there is a very strong relationship between the two variables, indicating that the model is effective.
