### Question 18
#### Part (a)
We can observe a positive correlation between phosphorus applied to the soil and phosphorus present in the plant, and some variability within the same X.

#### Part (b)
Find the means:
- $$\bar{x}=0.2834$$
- $$\bar{y}=157.5834$$

Let the best fitting line be $\hat{y} =  a + bx$
Calculate the slope and the intercept:
- $b = \frac{SXY}{SXX} = \frac{88.4667}{0.3267} = 270.82$
- $a = \bar{y}-b\bar{x} =  80.85$

Therefore, the function for the regrssion line is: $\hat{y} = 80.9 + 270.8x$ 

#### Part (c)
We first set up the hypotheses:
- $H_0: \quad b = 0$
- $H_a: \quad b \neq 0$  
(with $\alpha = 0.05$)

$\Since p-value = 0.003 < 0.05, we reject H_0$  
The data provide sufficient evidence of a linear relationship

#### Part (d)
$t_{n-2,0.1} = t_{10,0.1} = 1.812$

$x_0 = 0.20$

$SE_{\hat{y}} = s \cdot \sqrt{ \frac{1}{n} + \frac{(x_0 - \bar{x})^2}{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2} } = 12.6264$
$s=\sqrt{\frac{\sum (y_i - \hat{y_i})^2}{n-2}} = 39.04190$
From the information presented in the table:
90% CI = $(112.130, 157.900)$
