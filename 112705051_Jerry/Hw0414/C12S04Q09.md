### Question 9
#### Part (a)
With a $r^2$ value of 0.027, the difference in screen size accounts for just 2.7% of the pricing variation.  
 As a result, there is little correlation between screen size and cost.

#### Part (b)

- Normal Probability  Plot: A nearly straight line connects the spots.  
As a result, it appears that the normalcy assumption is fair and not obviously broken.  
- Versus Fitted: The residuals are dispersed rather equally around 0 and there is no discernible pattern.  
Therefore, it appears that the equal variance assumption is likewise upheld.

## Part (c)

No distinct linear trend can be found.  
 The linearity assumption thus seems to be broken.
