## Question 11
### Part(a)
We first establish the following table:
| Voter | $Rank_R$ | $Rank_D$ | $d$    | $d^2$    |
| ----- | ------- | ------- | ---- | ----- |
| 1     | 7.5     | 3       | 4.5  | 20.25 |
| 2     | 4       | 7       | -3   | 9     |
| 3     | 3       | 12      | -9   | 81    |
| 4     | 12      | 1       | 11   | 121   |
| 5     | 10      | 8       | 2    | 4     |
| 6     | 7.5     | 11      | -3.5 | 12.25 |
| 7     | 6       | 4       | 2    | 4     |
| 8     | 11      | 2       | 9    | 81    |
| 9     | 1       | 10      | -9   | 81    |
| 10    | 5       | 9       | -4   | 16    |
| 11    | 9       | 5.5     | 3.5  | 12.25 |
| 12    | 2       | 5.5     | -3.5 | 12.25 |

The formula of calculating Spearman's correlation cofefficient $r_f$ is:

$$
r_f=1-\frac{6 \sum{d_i^2}}{n(n^2-1)}
$$

Substitute the given values:

$$
r_f=1-\frac{6 \sum{d_i^2}}{n(n^2-1)}=1-\frac{6}{n(n^2-1)}(20.25+9+ \dot +12.25)=1-\frac{6 \times 454}{12(12^2-1)}=-0.587
$$

Therefore, the correlation coefficient is -0.587

### Part(b)
We first set up the hypotheses:
- $H_0$: There is no rank correlation between rating and distance
- $H_a$: There is a negative rank correlation between rating and distance

We use the table to find the critical value:

With $n=12$, $\alpha=0.05$, and a single-tailed test, the critical value is 0.497.

Since the absolute value of the correlation coefficient 0.587 exceeds 0.497, we reject the null hypothesis. 
Therefore, we can encapsulate that there's a negative rank correlation between rating and distance.
