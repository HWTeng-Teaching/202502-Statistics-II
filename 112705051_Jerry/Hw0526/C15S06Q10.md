## Question 10
### Part(a)
This is a repeated measures (within-subjects) design, where each of the 5 children tasted and rated all 4 antibiotics. The same subjects are measured under multiple treatments.

### Part(b)
- Normality:
  - The normal probability plot of residuals should follow a straight line. Deviations suggest non-normality.
  - Visual assessment needed: If the plot shows systematic curvature, normality is violated.
- Sphericity (Equal Variances):
  - The residuals vs. antibiotics plot should show random scatter with no patterns.
  - Visual assessment needed: If residuals fan out or cluster by antibiotic, variances are unequal.
- Conclusion: If either assumption is violated (common with small samples/ordinal data), non-parametric tests are preferred.

### Part(c)
First, we set up the hypotheses: 
- $H_0$: No difference in median ratings across antibiotics.  
- $H_a$: At least one antibiotic’s median rating differs.  

| Child | Antibiotic 1 | Antibiotic 2 | Antibiotic 3 | Antibiotic 4 |
| ----- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| 1     | 4.8          | 2.2          | 6.8          | 6.2          |
| 2     | 8.1          | 9.2          | 6.6          | 9.6          |
| 3     | 5.0          | 2.6          | 3.6          | 6.5          |
| 4     | 7.9          | 9.4          | 5.3          | 8.5          |
| 5     | 3.9          | 7.4          | 2.1          | 2.0          |

| Child | Rank 1 | Rank 2 | Rank 3 | Rank 4 |
| ----- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| 1     | 3      | 4      | 1      | 2      |
| 2     | 3      | 2      | 4      | 1      |
| 3     | 2      | 4      | 3      | 1      |
| 4     | 3      | 1      | 4      | 2      |
| 5     | 3      | 1      | 4      | 2      |

| Antibiotic | Sum of Ranks   |
| ---------- | -------------- |
| 1          | 3+3+2+3+3 = 14 |
| 2          | 4+2+4+1+1 = 12 |
| 3          | 1+4+3+4+4 = 16 |
| 4          | 2+1+1+2+2 = 8  |

Now we use the H-test using the formula below:

$$
H=\frac{12}{bk(k+1)} \sum(T_i^2) -3b(k+1) =79.2-75=4.2
$$

With $df=4-1=3$, and $\alpha=0.05$, critical value is $X_{3,0.05}^2=7.814$

Since the calculated H does not exceed the critical value, we cannot to reject the null hypothesis. There's no difference in median ratings across antibiotics.
