## Question 12
### Part(a)
First we set up the table:
| Runner | Rank X | Rank Y | $d = X - Y$ | $d^2$ |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ----------- | ----- |
| 1      | 3      | 1      | 2           | 4     |
| 2      | 1      | 2      | -1          | 1     |
| 3      | 6.5    | 3      | 3.5         | 12.25 |
| 4      | 4      | 4      | 0           | 0     |
| 5      | 2      | 5      | -3          | 9     |
| 6      | 5      | 6      | -1          | 1     |
| 7      | 8      | 7      | 1           | 1     |
| 8      | 6.5    | 8      | -1.5        | 2.25  |
| 9      | 9      | 9      | 0           | 0     |

The formula of calculating Spearman's correlation cofefficient $r_f$ is:

$$
r_f=1-\frac{6 \sum{d_i^2}}{n(n^2-1)}
$$

Substitute the given values:

$$
r_f=1-\frac{6 \sum{d_i^2}}{n(n^2-1)}=1-\frac{6 \times 30.5}{9 \times 80}=0.7458
$$

Therefore, the correlation coefficient is 0.7458

### Part(b)
We now set up the hypotheses:
- $H_0$: $r_s=0$
- $H_a$: $r_s \neq 0$

With n=9, $\alpha =0.05$, and a two-sided test, the critical value is 0.683

Since the calculated correlation coefficient exceeds the critical value, we therefore reject the null hypothesis.

There is significant evidence at the 0.05 level to conclude a positive rank correlation between years of competitive running and performance in the 10-kilometer race. This suggests that more experience is associated with better (faster) finish times.
