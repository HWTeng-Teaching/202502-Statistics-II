### 6.

$H_0$: The distribution of four training periods are identical.

$H_a$: At least one training period results is in a different distribution.

Ranking:

| Training Period (hours) |   0.5   |   1.0   |   1.5   |   2.0   | 
|-------------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|       child 1                  | 13      | 16      | 2       | 2       | 
|        child 2            | 20      | 10      | 7.5     | 10      |

Using the Kruskal-Wallis H-Test:

$$
H=\frac{12}{N(N+1)} \sum(\frac{T_i^2}{n_i}) -3(N+1)
= \frac{12}{20(20+1)} (\frac{86^2}{5}+\frac{60^2}{5}+\frac{40^2}{5}+\frac{24^2}{5})-3(20+1) \approx 12.2686
$$

Checking the chi-square table:

critical value is $X_{3,0.01}^2=11.3449$

Since $H=12.2686$ is larger than the critical value, we reject $H_0$. At least one distrubution is different.
