### Q32
#### a.
The p-value (0.113) is greater than the common significance level of 0.05. This means we fail to reject the null hypothesis at the 5% significance level. The 95% confidence interval (0.9867, 1.1178) includes 1, further supporting that the true mean could be 1.

Conclusion: There is no strong statistical evidence to suggest that the population mean weight differs from 1.

#### b.
construct a 95% C.I.

$t_{26; 0.025} = 1.64$  
$\bar{x} \pm t_{26; 0.025} \times \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} = 1.0522 \pm 1.64 \times \frac{0.1657}{\sqrt{27}} \approx (0.9867, 1.1178)$
