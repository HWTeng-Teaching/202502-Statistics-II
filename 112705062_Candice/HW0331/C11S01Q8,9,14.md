We might not be willing to assume normality automatically, because:

The data is based on proportions, which are bounded between 0 and 1, making it less likely to follow a normal distribution unless the proportions are not too close to 0 or 1 and the sample size is large.

However, since the proportion is based on 100 items per day and observed over 25 days, the sample size is moderate.

By the Central Limit Theorem, if the number of defective items each day is not too small or too large, the sampling distribution of the proportion could be approximately normal.
