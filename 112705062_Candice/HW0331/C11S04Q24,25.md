### 24.
#### a.
blocks: items

treatments: stores

#### b.

$H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2 = \mu_3 = \mu_4$ 

$H_a:$ at least one mean is different

set $\alpha = 0.05$

Since $F=26.52 > F{(3,21,0.05)}=3.075$, we reject $H_0$.

There are significant differences in prices from store to store.

#### c.

$H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2 = ... = \mu_8$

$H_a:$ at least one mean is different

set $\alpha = 0.05$

Since $F=35.32 > F{(7,21,0.05)}=2.49$, we reject $H_0$.

There are significant differences in prices from block to block.
