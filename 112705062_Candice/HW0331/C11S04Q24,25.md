### 24.
#### a.
blocks: items

treatments: stores

#### b.

$H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2 = \mu_3 = \mu_4$ 

$H_a:$ at least one mean is different

set $\alpha = 0.05$

Since $F=26.52 > F{(3,21,0.05)}=3.075$, we reject $H_0$.

There are significant differences in prices from store to store.

#### c.

$H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2 = ... = \mu_8$

$H_a:$ at least one mean is different

set $\alpha = 0.05$

Since $F=35.32 > F{(7,21,0.05)}=2.49$, we reject $H_0$.

There are significant differences in prices from block to block.

### 25.
#### a.

$q_{0.05}(k,df) = q_{0.05}(4,21) = 3.942$

#### b.

$\omega = q_{0.05}(k,df) * \sqrt{\frac{MSE}{b}} = 3.942 * \sqrt{0.1658}{8} \approx 0.5675$

#### c.

| Comparison                | Difference          | Significant?  |
|---------------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| $\bar{x}_1$ - $\bar{x}_2$ | 0.4875 < 0.5675     | No            |
| $\bar{x}_1$ - $\bar{x}_3$ | 0.205 < 0.5675      | No            |
| $\bar{x}_1$ - $\bar{x}_4$ | 1.659  > 0.5675     | Yes           |
| $\bar{x}_2$ - $\bar{x}_3$ | 0.2825 < 0.5675     | No            |
| $\bar{x}_2$ - $\bar{x}_4$ | 1.1713 > 0.5675     | Yes           |
| $\bar{x}_3$ - $\bar{x}_4$ | 1.4538 > 0.5675     | Yes           |

we can see that $\bar{x_4}$ differs significantly from all the other three means.
