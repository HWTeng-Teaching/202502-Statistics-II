#### a. 

Do these data provide sufficient evidence to indicate a difference in the mean GRE scores?

Let:

- $H_0$: $\mu_1 = \mu_2 = \mu_3$  
- $H_a$: at least one mean is different

ANOVA Table

| Source      | df  | SS         | MS         | F     |
|-------------|-----|------------|------------|-------|
| Treatments  | 2   | 74806.67   | 37403.33   | 4.47  |
| Error       | 27  | 225930     | 8367.78    |       |
| Total       | 29  | 300736.67  |            |       |

Since $F > F_{0.05, 2, 27} \approx 3.35$, we reject $H_0$.  

There is sufficient evidence to conclude a significant difference in mean GRE scores between the three programs at the 5% level.

#### b. 

95% Confidence Interval for Life vs Physical Sciences

- $\bar{X}_1 = \text{mean of Life Sciences} = 608$
- $\bar{X}_2 = \text{mean of Physical Sciences} = 653$
- $MSE = 8367.78$
- $n_1 = 10$, $n_2 = 10$
- $df = 27$
- $t_{0.025, 27} = 2.052$

Then,

$$
\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2 \pm t_{\alpha/2, df} \cdot \sqrt{MSE \left( \frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2} \right)} \\
= 599 - 637 \pm 2.228 \cdot \sqrt{13042.4 \left( \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{5} \right)} \\
= -38 \pm 2.228 \cdot \sqrt{13042.4 \cdot 0.4} \\
= -38 \pm 2.228 \cdot \sqrt{5216.96} \\
= -38 \pm 2.228 \cdot 72.25 \\
= -38 \pm 160.8
$$

**95% CI:** $(-249,\ 153)$

This wide interval includes 0, which agrees with the ANOVA result (no significant difference).

#### c. Tukey's HSD (Only if ANOVA was significant)

Since ANOVA was **not** significant at $\alpha = 0.05$, no need for Tukey’s test.

If it **were** significant, we’d use:

$$
\omega = q_{\alpha}(k, df) \cdot \sqrt{\frac{MSE}{n}} \\
= q \cdot \sqrt{\frac{13042.4}{5}} \\
= q \cdot 51.0
$$

Where $q$ is the studentized range statistic (depends on $\alpha = 0.05$, $k = 3$, $df = 10$). You’d then compare pairwise mean differences to HSD to find where the differences are.
