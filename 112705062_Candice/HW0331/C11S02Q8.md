#### a.

$H_0: \mu_A = \mu_B = \mu_C$

$H_a$: At least one mean is different  

set $\alpha = 0.05\$

$G=380+199+261=840$

$CM=840^2/11=64145.45$

$total SS=65286-64145.45=1140.55$

$SST=380^2/5+199^2/3+262^2/3-64145.45=641.88$

#### b.
Reject $H_0$ when $F>F{2,8,0.05}$

Since 5.149 > 4.46, we reject $H_0$. 

The data provides sufficient evidence to indicate a difference in mean student scores after treatment for three methods.
