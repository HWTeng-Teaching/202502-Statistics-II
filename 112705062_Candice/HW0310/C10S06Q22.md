### Q22  
#### a.  

$H_0: \sigma_1^2 = \sigma_2^2$  

$H_a: \sigma_1^2 \neq \sigma_2^2$  

let $\alpha$ = 0.05  

$F = \frac{\sigma_1^2}{\sigma_2^2 } $  

$F = \frac{2.96}{1.54} =1.922$

$F{14,14,0.025}=2.9786$

$p-value = 2 \times P(F > 1.922) > 2 \times 0.025 = 0.05$  

Since p-value>0.05, we don't reject $H_0$.

There is no sufficient evidence to indicate a difference between the variabilities of the closing prices of the two stocks for the populations associated with the two samples.

#### b.

construct a 99%. C.I. for the two population variances:

$C.I. = \left( \frac{s_1^2}{s_2^2} \times \frac{1}{F_{n_1-1,n_2-1,(\alpha/2)}}, \frac{s_1^2}{s_2^2} \times F_{n_2-1,n_1-1,(\alpha/2)} \right)$

$C.I. = \left( \frac{s_1^2}{s_2^2} \times \frac{1}{F_{14,14,0.005}}, \frac{s_1^2}{s_2^2} \times F_{14,14,0.005} \right)$

$=(0.4471,8.2627)$
