### Q22  
#### a.  

$H_0: \sigma_1^2 = \sigma_2^2$  

$H_a: \sigma_1^2 \neq \sigma_2^2$  

set $\alpha$ = 0.05  

$F = \frac{\sigma_1^2}{\sigma_2^2 } $  

$F = \frac{2.96}{1.54} =1.922$

$F{14,14,0.025}=2.9786$

$p-value = 2 \times P(F > 1.922) > 2 \times 0.025 = 0.05$  

Since p-value>0.05, we reject $H_0$.

There is sufficient evidence to indicate a difference between the variabilities of the closing prices of the two stocks for the populations associated with the two samples.
